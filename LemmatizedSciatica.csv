"PURPOSE: Compression of the sciatic nerve in its path along the piriformis muscle can produce sciatica - like symptom. There be 6 predominant type of sciatic nerve variation with type 1 be the much common ( 84. 2 % ), follow by type 2 ( 13. 9 % ). However, there be scarce literature on the prevalence of sciatic nerve variation in that diagnose with sciatica. material AND method: The chart of 95 patient clinically diagnose with sciatica who have a magnetic resonance image of the pelvis / hip be retrospectively study. All patient have T1 - weight axial, coronal, and sagittal image. Magnetic resonance imaging be interpret separately by 2 board - certify fellowship - train musculoskeletal radiologist to identify the sciatic nerve variant. result: Seven case be exclude because of inadequate image. Of the remain 88 patient, 5 have bilateral sciatica result in a sample size of 93 limb. Fifty - two ( 55. 9 % ) have type 1 sciatic nerve anatomy, 39 ( 41. 9 % ) have type 2, and 2 ( 2. 2 % ) have type 3. The proportion of type 1 and 2 variation be significantly different from the normal distribution ( P < 0. 001 ), whereas type 3, 4, 5, and 6 variant be not ( P = 1. 00 ). conclusion: There be strong statistical significance regard the relationship between sciatic nerve variation and the clinical diagnosis of sciatica. Preoperative magnetic resonance image can be consider in sciatica patient to prevent iatrogenic injury in pelvic surgery.","PURPOSE:

Compression of the sciatic nerve in its path along the piriformis muscle can produce sciatica-like symptoms. There are 6 predominant types of sciatic nerve variations with type 1 being the most common (84.2%), followed by type 2 (13.9%). However, there is scarce literature on the prevalence of sciatic nerve variation in those diagnosed with sciatica.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The charts of 95 patients clinically diagnosed with sciatica who had a magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis/hip were retrospectively studied. All patients had T1-weighted axial, coronal, and sagittal images. Magnetic resonance imagings were interpreted separately by 2 board-certified fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists to identify the sciatic nerve variant.
RESULTS:

Seven cases were excluded because of inadequate imaging. Of the remaining 88 patients, 5 had bilateral sciatica resulting in a sample size of 93 limbs. Fifty-two (55.9%) had type 1 sciatic nerve anatomy, 39 (41.9%) had type 2, and 2 (2.2%) had type 3. The proportions of type 1 and 2 variations were significantly different from the normal distribution (P < 0.001), whereas type 3, 4, 5, and 6 variants were not (P = 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS:

There is strong statistical significance regarding the relationship between sciatic nerve variation and the clinical diagnosis of sciatica. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging can be considered in sciatica patients to prevent iatrogenic injury in pelvic surgery.","PubMed"

"Carbonic anhydrase - 8 ( CA8 ) be a intracellular protein that function as a allosteric inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor - 1 ( ITPR1 ) critical to intracellular Ca++ release, synaptic function and neuronal excitability.

The piriformis muscle has been said to receive innervation from L5 to S3 ventral rami with most sources using S1 and S2 ventral rami as the most common innervation this muscle. However, descriptions of the nerve in the literature are vague. Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the anatomy of the nerve supply to the piriformis muscle. Twenty sides from ten fresh-frozen cadavers were studied. Specifically, via anterior dissection of the sacral plexus, branches to the piriformis were identified. Once identified, the nerves to the piriformis muscle were traced proximally to clarify their origin. Nerves supplying the piriformis muscle existed on all sides. On 80% of sides, the piriformis was innervated by two to three nerves. The origin of these nerves was from the superior gluteal nerve on 14 sides (70%), inferior gluteal nerve on one side (5%), L5 ventral ramus on one side (5%), S1 ventral ramus on 17 sides (85%), and S2 ventral ramus on 14 sides (70%), respectively. The most common nerve branches to the piriformis are from the superior gluteal nerve, and the ventral rami of S1 and S2. Based on our study, a single ""nerve to piriformis"" does not exist in the majority of specimens thus this term should be abandoned. Clin. Anat. 32:282-286, 2019.
