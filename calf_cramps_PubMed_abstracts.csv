"Frequent and painful nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) require an effective therapy to improve quality of life and sleep performance in patients.
METHOD:

In a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study (NIS) data on the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of quinine sulfate were collected in daily medical management in adult patients with frequent and painful nocturnal leg cramps.
RESULTS:

In total 596 patients were included into the study. Of these, 568 patients finished the study as planned (95.3%). Number, duration and pain intensity of NLC were reduced in the majority of patients after 2 weeks of therapy with quinine sulfate 200 mg OD. Physicians rated global assessment of treatment effect as ""good"" and ""very good"" in 535 patients (92.4%) which was concurrent with the patients' rating (""good"" and ""very good"" by 534 patients = 92.2%), based on the full analysis set of 579 patients. Furthermore, quality of life and sleep were improved. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 35/592 patients (5.9%). Severe adverse events were not observed. The total incidence of therapy-associated adverse effects was comparable in the subgroup of patients with concomitant á-blocker therapy (149/592 patients, 25.2%; totally 10%, subgroup 10.1%). Efficacy and tolerability of quinine sulfate were evaluated as ""very good"" or ""good"" by the majority of physicians and patients.
CONCLUSIONS:

The present NIS confirms effectiveness and tolerability of the therapy with quinine sulfate in daily clinical routine for adult patients with frequent and painful nocturnal leg cramps.",PubMed
"A small proportion of patients with exertional leg pain (ELP) have deep posterior chronic exertional compartment syndrome (dp-CECS). These individuals report pain, tightness and cramps deep in the calf muscles that are elicited by exercise, but may also be present during rest to a lesser extent. Physical examination often reveals painful palpation of the flexor muscles in the area immediately dorsomedial to the tibial bone. Diagnosis is confirmed by intracompartmental pressure testing. Various entities may mimic or coincide with dp-CECS, including medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) and popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). Fasciotomy of multiple flexor muscles is the only treatment that achieves a beneficial outcome. The aim of this overview is to discuss the diagnosis and management of dp-CECS.",PubMed

"BACKGROUND:

Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease where a cramp-like leg pain is exhibited during walking, which affects gait and limits walking distance. Specifically-designed rocker-soled shoes were purported to mechanically unload the calf musculature and increase walking distances until IC pain.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

Do three-curve rocker-soled shoes increase walking distance and what are the biomechanical differences during pain-free walking and IC pain-induced walking, when compared with control shoes?
METHODS:

Following NHS ethical approval, 31 individuals with claudication (age 69?ñ?10 years, stature 1.7?ñ?0.9?m, mass 83.2?ñ?16.2?kg, ankle-brachial pressure index 0.55?ñ?0.14) were randomised in this cross-over trial. Gait parameters whilst walking with rocker-soled shoes were compared with control shoes at three intervals of pain-free walking, at onset of IC pain (initial claudication distance) and when IC intensifies and prevents them walking any further (absolute claudication distance). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed on gait variables.
RESULTS:

When compared with control shoes, rocker-soled shoes reduced ankle power generation (mean 2.1 vs 1.6?W/kg, respectively; p?=?0.006) and altered sagittal kinematics of the hip, knee and ankle. However, this did not translate to a significant increase in initial (138?m vs 146?m, respectively) or absolute (373?m vs 406?m, respectively) claudication distances. In response to IC pain, similar adaptations in temporal-spatial parameters and the sagittal kinematics were observed between the shoe types.
SIGNIFICANCE:

The three-curved rocker shoes, in their current design, do not augment gait sufficiently to enhance walking distance, when compared with control shoes, and therefore cannot be recommended for the intermittent claudication population. Clinical Reg No. (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT02505503.

"OBJECTIVE:

Muscle cramps occur in >50% of diabetic patients and reduce the quality of life. No effective treatment is available. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections for treating cramps in diabetic patients with neuropathy.
METHODS:

This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled perspective study investigated the efficacy and safety of BTX-A intramuscular injection for treating calf or foot cramps refractory to common pharmacological drugs. Fifty diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and cramps were randomly assigned to 2 matched groups. BTX-A (100 or 30 units) or saline was injected on each side into the gastrocnemius or the small flexor foot muscles. Changes in pain intensity (primary outcome) and cramp frequency were evaluated over the course of 20 weeks after BTX-A administration. Cramp interference in daily life and the electrophysiological cramp threshold frequency were also measured. The treatment was repeated 5 months after first injection in 19 responders.
RESULTS:

All outcome measures improved significantly after BTX-A compared with placebo. The changes with respect to baseline were already significant after 1 week and persisted up to week 14. Only 5 of 25 (20%) patients were nonresponders (<50% decrease of the primary outcome). The responses to a second BTX-A injection provided results similar to the first administration. Mild pain at the injection site (4/25 cases) was the only adverse event, and it disappeared within 2 to 3 days.
INTERPRETATION:

Local BTX-A infiltration is an efficacious and safe procedure for obtaining a sustained amelioration of muscle cramps associated with diabetic neuropathy. Ann Neurol 2018;84:682-690.",PubMed
"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of calf muscle cramps and possible influencing factors for pregnant women in China. Methods: Using a multi-stage stratified probability proportional to size cluster randomization sampling method during 2010-2012. A total of 3 582 pregnant women were investigated at 150 counties from 31 provinces in China mainland. Information on calf muscle cramps, demographic socio-economic status, pregnancy information, and the physical activities was collected through questionnaires. The semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect food intake of pregnant women. Dynamic cluster analysis was used to assess dietary pattern. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the possible influencing factors for calf muscle cramps. Results: The prevalence of calf muscle cramps was 32.9% (1 180/3 582) in Chinese pregnant women, which was 11.6% (87/748), 28.2% (420/1 492), and 50.2% (673/1 342), respectively, during the first, second and third trimester. There were significant differences between them (?(2)=349.16, P<0.001). Dietary patterns of the pregnant women were classified into three groups, which called relatively balanced pattern, high vegetables and fruits pattern, and high dairy pattern. Among the three groups, the prevalence of calf muscle cramps was 32.0% (952/2 971), 37.2% (186/500), and 37.8% (42/111), with significant differences (?(2)=6.39, P=0.041). The OR (95%CI) values of calf muscle cramps in the second and third trimester was 2.96 (2.28-3.83), and 8.02 (6.16-10.44), respectively, comparing with the first trimester. The OR (95%CI) values of calf muscle cramps in the women taking calcium before pregnant was 1.45 (1.19-1.76), comparing with the one who was not taken. The OR (95%CI) values of calf muscle cramps in the women who had been diagnosed by pregnancy-induced hypertension was 5.76 (2.06-16.12), comparing with the one who had not been diagnosed. The OR (95%CI) values of calf muscle cramps in the high vegetables and fruits pattern and high dairy pattern was 1.13 (0.91-1.41), and 1.18 (0.76-1.81), respectively, comparing with the relatively balanced pattern. Conclusion: The prevalence of calf muscle cramps was relatively high in Chinese pregnant women, which was significantly different among three trimesters. The residential areas, occupation, and pregnancy-induced hypertension might be related to the prevalence of calf muscle cramps. However, there was no significant difference among different dietary patterns.

"OBJECTIVES:

We investigated if neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of calf muscles prevents spontaneous calf cramps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

In 19 individuals affected by more than or equal to one calf cramp per week the gastrocnemius of the predominantly affected leg was stimulated twice a week (intervention leg, IL) over six weeks (3 ? 6 stimulation trains at 30 Hz above the individual cramp threshold frequency). The other leg served as control (CL). The participants were advised to record all spontaneous muscle cramps from two weeks before the intervention until two weeks after the last NMES session.
RESULTS:

The number of spontaneous calf cramps in the two weeks after the intervention was 78% lower (2.1?ñ?6.8 cramps) in the stimulated (p?<?0.001) and 63% lower (2.0?ñ?6.9 cramps) in the unstimulated calves (p?<?0.001), when compared to the two weeks prior to the intervention (IL: 9.6?ñ?12.4 cramps; CL: 5.5?ñ?12.7 cramps). Only in the IL, this improvement was accompanied by an increase in the cramp threshold frequency from 15.5?ñ?8.5 Hz before the NMES intervention to 21.7?ñ?12.4 Hz after the intervention. The severity of the remaining calf cramps tended to be lower in both legs after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS:

The applied stimulation protocol seems to provide an effective prevention strategy in individuals affected by regular calf cramps.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Up to 33% of the general population over 50 years of age are affected by nocturnal leg cramps. Currently there are no generally accepted clinical characteristics, which identify nocturnal leg cramps. This study aims to identify these clinical characteristics and to differentiate between them and the characteristics of restless leg syndrome and periodic limb disorder.
METHOD:

A systematic literature study was executed from December 2015 to May 2016. This study comprised of a systematic literature review of randomized clinical trials, observational studies on nocturnal and rest cramps of legs and other muscles, and other systematic and narrative reviews. Two researchers independently extracted literature data and analyzed this using a standardized reviewing protocol. Modified versions of the Cochrane Collaboration tools assessed the risk of bias. A Delphi study was conducted to assess agreement on the characteristics of nocturnal leg cramps.
RESULTS:

After systematic and manual searches, eight randomized trials and ten observational studies were included. On the basis of these we identified seven diagnostic characteristics of nocturnal leg cramps: intense pain, period of duration from seconds to maximum 10 minutes, location in calf or foot, location seldom in thigh or hamstrings, persistent subsequent pain, sleep disruption and distress.
CONCLUSION:

The seven above characteristics will enhance recognition of the condition, and help clinicians make a clear distinction between NLC and other sleep-related musculoskeletal disorder among older adults.

"OBJECTIVES:

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin (BTX) injection into the gastrocnemius muscles in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) who have frequent nocturnal calf cramps (NCCs).
DESIGN:

Prospective, randomized clinical trial.
SETTING:

Outpatient department for interventional pain management.
PARTICIPANTS:

Patients (N=50) with LSS who have NCCs at least once per week were enrolled.
INTERVENTION:

Patients were randomly allocated to receive either conservative treatments plus gabapentin (group GPN) or BTX injection (group BTX).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

We assessed back/leg pain intensity, the frequency and severity of NCCs, insomnia severity, and functional disability at baseline and after 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. Additionally, Patient Global Impression of Change was assessed.
RESULTS:

Forty-five patients completed all assessments (group GPN, n=21; group BTX, n=24). Compared with group GPN, leg pain intensity, cramp frequency, and cramp severity were significantly decreased in group BTX at all follow-up visits (all, P<.01). Also, insomnia significantly improved in group BTX at the 2-week (P=.018) and 1-month follow-up (P=.037). Functional disability significantly improved in group BTX at 2 weeks' follow-up (P=.041). At the 3-month follow-up, patients in group BTX reported a higher impression of improvement for NCC symptoms than did those in group GPN (P<.001). A mean dose of 642.8mg of gabapentin was given daily in group GPN, but 7 patients (33.3%) reported systemic side effects. There were no serious complications related to BTX use.
CONCLUSIONS:

BTX treatment appears to be effective and safe for NCCs in symptomatic LSS patients receiving conservative care.

"INTRODUCTION:

Involuntary, localised leg cramps are common and typically affect the calf muscles at night.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES:

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for idiopathic leg cramps? What are the effects of treatments for leg cramps in pregnancy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS:

We found 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS:

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics; anti-epileptic drugs; calcium salts; diltiazem; magnesium salts; multivitamin and mineral supplements; quinine; sodium chloride; stretching exercises; verapamil; vitamin B6 (pyridoxine); and vitamin E.",PubMed
"Skeletal muscles usually cramp at short lengths, where the tension that can be exerted by muscle fibers is low. Since high tension is an important anabolic stimulus, it is questionable if cramps can induce hypertrophy and strength gains. In the present study we investigated if electrically induced cramps (EIMCs) can elicit these adaptations.
METHODS:

15 healthy male adults were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG; n=10) and a control group (CG; n=5). The cramp protocol (CP) applied twice a week to one leg of the IG, consisted of 3x6 EIMCs, of 5 s each. Calf muscles of the opposite leg were stimulated equally, but were hindered from cramping by fixating the ankle at 0ø plantar flexion (nCP).
RESULTS:

After six weeks, the cross sectional area of the triceps surae was similarly increased in both the CP (+9.0ñ3.4%) and the nCP (+6.8ñ3.7%). By contrast, force of maximal voluntary contractions, measured at 0ø and 30ø plantar flexion, increased significantly only in nCP (0ø: +8.5ñ8.8%; 30ø: 11.7ñ13.7%).
CONCLUSION:

The present data indicate that muscle cramps can induce hypertrophy in calf muscles, though lacking high tension as an important anabolic stimulus.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of injection at trigger points on pain and sleep disturbance in patients with nocturnal calf cramps (NCCs).
METHODS:

Patients with NCCs that occurred at least once per week and who had myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) on the gastrocnemius muscles were enrolled in the study for 9 months. At the first visit (T0), we measured the intensity of NCC pain on an 11-point numeric rating scale, recorded the frequency of NCCs, and calculated the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). We then checked for MTrPs on the gastrocnemius muscles and injected 1-2 mL of 0.25% lidocaine into each of the trigger points. At 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 4 (T3) weeks after the first visit, we repeated the process performed at T0.
RESULTS:

Twelve patients completed the treatment schedule and attended the follow-up visits. Mean values of the numeric rating scale pain score, frequency of cramps, and ISI declined significantly at T1, T2, and T3 compared with baseline (all P < .01). Of 12 patients, 10 had clinical insomnia before treatment, and this number decreased significantly to 3 patients at T2 and 1 patient at T3 (P = .012 and P = .001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS:

These preliminary data show that injection at MTrPs in patients with NCCs not only alleviated pain and reduced the frequency of cramps but also lessened the severity of insomnia as measured by the ISI. A larger randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings and determine whether the effect lasts over the long term.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Pregnancy triggers a wide range of changes in a woman's body leading to various musculoskeletal dysfunctions. Most commonly reported musculoskeletal discomforts by pregnant women are low back pain and symphysis pubis pain. The culture and the environmental factors may influence the discomforts experienced by a pregnant woman. There is a dearth of literature in India, regarding the common musculoskeletal dysfunctions experienced by a pregnant woman, and hence this study.
METHOD:

A questionnaire to identify the musculoskeletal dysfunction was developed; content was validated and was translated to local languages through parallel back translation. 261 primiparous pregnant women participated in the study and filled the questionnaire in their native language.
RESULTS:

Among the musculoskeletal dysfunctions reported by the pregnant women, 64.6% reported calf muscle cramps, 37.1% reported foot pain, and 33.7% experienced low back pain in their third trimester. In the second trimester, common musculoskeletal dysfunctions experienced by the women were that of calf pain (47.8%), low back pain (42%), and pelvic girdle pain (37%).
CONCLUSION:

Musculoskeletal dysfunctions and general discomforts very commonly affect the activities of daily living of pregnant women. Understanding the common discomforts during various trimesters of pregnancy will help to develop a comprehensive program for prevention and cure.",PubMed
"Leg pain and discomfort are common complaints in any primary physician's clinic. Two common causes of pain or discomfort in legs are nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) and restless leg syndrome (RLS). NLC present as painful and sudden contractions mostly in part of the calf. Diagnosis of NLC is mainly clinical and sometimes involves investigations to rule out other mimics. RLS is a condition characterized by the discomfort or urge to move the lower limbs, which occurs at rest or in the evening/night. The similarity of RLS and leg cramps poses the issue of errors in diagnosing and differentiating the two. In this paper we review the pathopysiology of each entity and their diagnosis as well as treatment. The two conditions are then compared to appreciate the differences and similarities. Finally, suggestions are recommended for complete assessment.

"BACKGROUND:

To investigate if the cramp threshold frequency (CTF) can be altered by electrical muscle stimulation in a shortened position.
METHODS:

A total of 15 healthy male sport students were randomly allocated to an intervention (IG, n?=?10) and a non-treatment control group (CG, n?=?5). Calf muscles of both legs in the IG were stimulated equally twice a week over 6 weeks. The protocol was 3?5 s on, 10 s off, 150 æs impulse width, 30 Hz above the individual CTF, and was at 85% of the maximal tolerated stimulation energy. One leg was stimulated in a shortened position, inducing muscle cramps (CT), while the opposite leg was fixated in a neutral position at the ankle, hindering muscle cramps (nCT). CTF tests were performed prior to the first and 96 h after the 6(th) (3 w) and 12(th) (6 w) training session.
RESULTS:

After 3 w, the CTF had significantly (p<0.001) increased in CT calves from 23.3ñ5.7 Hz to 33.3ñ6.9 Hz, while it remained unchanged in nCT (pre: 23.6ñ5.7 Hz, mid: 22.3ñ3.5 Hz) and in both legs of the CG (pre: 21.8ñ3.2 Hz, mid: 22.0ñ2.7 Hz). Only CT saw further insignificant increases in the CTF. The applied stimulation energy (mAý ? æs) positively correlated with the effect on the CTF (r?=?0.92; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS:

The present study may be useful for developing new non-pharmacological strategies to reduce cramp susceptibilit",PubMed
"AIMS:

The main aim of the case series was to inform further experimental research to determine the effectiveness of myofascial trigger point (MTrP) therapy for the treatment of triceps surae dysfunction.
PARTICIPANTS:

Ten participants with triceps surae dysfunction were recruited (4 females and 6 males); mean ageñstandard deviation=43ñ7.1 years.
METHODS:

Participants were screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria and the following outcomes measures were assessed at baseline and discharge; lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), verbal numerical rating scale (NRS), MTrP prevalence, ankle dorsiflexion range of movement (ROM) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). Intervention involved trigger point (TrP) pressure release, self MTrP release and a home stretching programme.
RESULTS:

There was a high prevalence of active/latent MTrPs and possible myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) for all 10 participants at baseline. Active MTrP prevalence decreased to 0%, while latent MTrPs were still present at discharge. There were positive changes in most outcome measures (LEFS, NRS, ROM and PPT) for all 10 participants. Short term to medium term treatment outcomes (6 week post discharge) showed an overall mean LEFS increase of 11 points from 61/80 at baseline to 72/80 at discharge.
CONCLUSION:

This case series suggests that a brief course of multimodal MTrP therapy would be helpful for some patients with sub-acute or chronic calf pain. Important preliminary data was gathered, that will inform more rigorous research in this under investigated area.

"NTRODUCTION:

Although highly prevalent and painful, night-time calf muscle cramping is poorly understood, and no treatment has shown consistent efficacy or safety.
METHODS:

One hundred sixty adults were recruited from New South Wales, Australia, including 80 who had night-time calf cramping at least once per week and 80 age- and gender-matched adults who did not. Participants were assessed using reliable tests of lower limb strength, flexibility, morphometrics, circulation, and sensation, and were questioned about health and lifestyle factors, diet, medications, exercise, symptomatology, sleeping habits, and footwear.
RESULTS:

Conditional logistic regression identified 3 factors independently associated with night-time calf muscle cramps: muscle twitching (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.6-15.5, P = 0.01); lower limb tingling (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.3, P = 0.003); and foot dorsiflexion weakness (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 0.002), which represented other measures of lower limb weakness in the model.
CONCLUSIONS:

Night-time calf muscle cramps were associated with markers of neurological dysfunction and potential musculoskeletal therapeutic targets.",PubMed
"PURPOSE:

To evaluate the impact of nocturnal calf cramping (a condition that affects one in two people over 60 years of age) on quality of sleep and health-related quality of life.
METHODS:

Eighty adults who experienced nocturnal calf cramp at least once per week and eighty age- and sex-matched controls who never experienced nocturnal cramp were recruited from the Greater Newcastle and Central Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. All participants completed the SF-36v2 and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Survey (MOS-SS).
RESULTS:

People who experienced nocturnal muscle cramps reported more sleep disturbance (p < 0.001), less adequate sleep (p = 0.001), less quantity of sleep (p = 0.02) and more snoring (p = 0.03). Both sleep problem summary indices for the MOS-SS identified people who experienced nocturnal muscle cramp as having more sleep problems than the controls. People who experienced nocturnal muscle cramps had lower health-related quality of life for the SF-36 domains role physical (p = 0.007), bodily pain (p = 0.003) and general health (p = 0.02). SF-36 domains that primarily relate to mental health were not significantly different between groups. The impact of nocturnal calf cramps on health-related quality of life was largely explained by their negative impact on quality of sleep.
CONCLUSIONS:

Nocturnal calf muscle cramps are associated with substantially reduced quality of sleep and reduced physical aspects of health-related quality of life.",PubMed
"A lot of drugs can induce hypomagnesemia as side effect. On the other hand, magnesium deficiency may be a risk factor for digitalis and drugs known to prolong the QT-interval and thus favour the development of torsades-de-pointes tachycardias. Controversely, the indication for most oral magnesium supplements in Germany is: proven magnesium deficiency if this is the cause for muscular troubles (neuromuscular disturbances, calf cramps). Due to this cutback magnesium attracts poor attention in clinical practice and the determination of serum magnesium concentrations is seldom ordered. Moreover, the lower level of the reference range for serum magnesium is often kept too low. As a consequence hypomagnesemia as side effect remains frequently undetected.",PubMed
"Up to 60 percent of adults report that they have had nocturnal leg cramps. The recurrent, painful tightening usually occurs in the calf muscles and can cause severe insomnia. The exact mechanism is unknown, but the cramps are probably caused by muscle fatigue and nerve dysfunction rather than electrolyte or other abnormalities. Nocturnal leg cramps are associated with vascular disease, lumbar canal stenosis, cirrhosis, hemodialysis, pregnancy, and other medical conditions. Medications that are strongly associated with leg cramps include intravenous iron sucrose, conjugated estrogens, raloxifene, naproxen, and teriparatide. A history and physical examination are usually sufficient to differentiate nocturnal leg cramps from other conditions, such as restless legs syndrome, claudication, myositis, and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory evaluation and specialized testing usually are unnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. Limited evidence supports treating nocturnal leg cramps with exercise and stretching, or with medications such as magnesium, calcium channel blockers, carisoprodol, or vitamin B(12). Quinine is no longer recommended to treat leg cramps.",PubMed
