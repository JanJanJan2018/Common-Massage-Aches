Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a nonspecific label. When employing it, one should define the type of TOS as arterial TOS, venous TOS, or neurogenic TOS. Each type has different symptoms and physical findings by which the three types can easily be identified. Neurogenic TOS (NTOS) is by far the most common, comprising well over 90% of all TOS patients. Arterial TOS is the least common accounting for no more than 1%. Many patients are erroneously diagnosed as ?vascular? TOS, a nonspecific misnomer, whereas they really have NTOS. The Adson Test of noting a radial pulse deficit in provocative positions has been shown to be of no clinical value and should not be relied upon to make the diagnosis of any of the three types. The test is normal in most patients with NTOS and at the same time can be positive in many control volunteers.

Arterial TOS is caused by emboli arising from subclavian artery stenosis or aneurysms. Symptoms are those of arterial ischemia and x-rays almost always disclose a cervical rib or anomalous first rib. Venous TOS presents with arm swelling, cyanosis, and pain due to subclavian vein obstruction, with or without thrombosis. Neurogenic TOS is due to brachial plexus compression usually from scarred scalene muscles secondary to neck trauma, whiplash injuries being the most common. Symptoms include extremity paresthesia, pain, and weakness as well as neck pain and occipital headache. Physical exam is most important and includes several provocative maneuvers including neck rotation and head tilting, which elicit symptoms in the contralateral extremity; the upper limb tension test, which is comparable to straight leg raising; and abducting the arms to 90ø in external rotation, which usually brings on symptoms within 60 seconds.

Indications for subclavian arteriography in thoracic outlet syndrome

Historically, when Adson1 first described his maneuver in 1927, what today is called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) was then called scalenus anticus syndrome. It was thought to be an arterial problem caused by compression of the subclavian artery by the anterior scalene muscle (ASM). Many things have changed over the past 80 years. Today, it is recognized that in addition to the subclavian artery, the subclavian vein or brachial plexus can also be compressed, and structures other than the ASM can do the compressing. This is what led in 1956 to renaming this condition by the all-inclusive label, thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).2

TOS is a broad term whose definition is ?upper extremity symptoms due to compression of the neurovascular bundle by various structures in the area just above the first rib and behind the clavicle?. The term TOS does not specify whether the compressing agent is muscle or bone, and it also fails to identify the structure being compressed. However, since it is usually fairly easy to differentiate arterial from venous or neurogenic involvement, the term TOS should be preceded by an appropriate modifier: Arterial TOS (ATOS), venous TOS (VTOS), or neurogenic TOS (NTOS).
Incidence

NTOS comprises over 90% of all TOS cases seen today while ATOS is less than 1%. Although the incidence in any one medical center is influenced by referral patterns, ATOS is the least common of the three types in all series. Our 40 years of experience in treating TOS includes more than 2500 operations, but only 11 were for ATOS, an incidence of less than 1%. The incidence of operations for VTOS was 3%, while over 95% of the TOS procedures were for NTOS. Thus, the large majority of patients presenting with arm pain and paresthesia will have neurogenic, not arterial, TOS.
Etiology

The history prior to the onset of symptoms can be helpful. Most patients with NTOS have a history of neck trauma preceding their symptoms, auto accidents being the most common and repetitive stress at work being next most common. VTOS, sometimes called effort thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease, may be preceded by excessive activity with the arms. Symptoms of ATOS usually develop spontaneously, unrelated to trauma or work. Arterial TOS is almost always associated with a cervical rib or an anomalous first rib and, thus, a normal neck x-ray is a good screening test to rule out ATOS.
Cervical ribs

Cervical ribs occur in less than 1% of the population and about 70% are in women. Most cervical ribs are asymptomatic. However, the cervical rib is a predisposition to develop NTOS following neck trauma, most often whiplash injuries.3 Symptomatic cervical ribs usually produce symptoms of NTOS, but a few will press against the subclavian artery and result in either stenosis or aneurysm formation. This is the etiology of ATOS. The only patients we have seen develop ATOS had either a complete cervical rib or an anomalous first rib. Since ATOS is usually asymptomatic until arterial emboli occur, asymptomatic patients found to have one of these rib anomalies are followed with duplex scans every few years to detect silent arterial abnormalities. If arterial abnormalities develop, surgical repair of the artery and excision of the rib should be performed before ATOS develops.
Symptoms

The term ?vascular? TOS is nonspecific. It implies arterial or venous compression but it also expresses uncertainty as to which structure is involved. Thus, the term ?vascular TOS? should be replaced by a more specific label, which can be differentiated by history, symptoms, and physical findings as outlined below.
A. Arterial TOS

The symptoms of ATOS include digital ischemia, claudication, pallor, coldness, paresthesia, and pain in the hand but seldom in the shoulder or neck. These symptoms are the result of arterial emboli arising either from mural thrombus in a subclavian artery aneurysm or from thrombus forming just distal to subclavian artery stenosis. In this situation, the pallor and coldness are due to arterial ischemia and not Raynaud?s phenomenon.
B. Venous TOS

Swelling of the arm, plus cyanosis, is strong evidence of subclavian vein obstruction, either thrombotic or nonthrombotic. Pain or aching is often present, but may also be absent. The arm swelling seen in VTOS is not a feature of either ATOS or NTOS. Paresthesia in the fingers and hands is common in venous TOS and may be secondary to swelling in the hand rather than to nerve compression in the thoracic outlet area.
C. Neurogenic TOS

Pain, paresthesia, and weakness in the hand, arm, and shoulder, plus neck pain and occipital headaches, are the classical symptoms of NTOS. Raynaud?s phenomenon, hand coldness and color changes, is also frequently seen in NTOS. It is the latter symptoms that can lead to an erroneous diagnosis of ATOS. The incidence of specific symptoms in our last 50 patients is seen in Table I.

Occipital headache	76
Paresthesia:	98

In NTOS, the coldness and color changes are not caused by ischemia resulting from obstruction of the subclavian artery. Rather, they are due to an overactive sympathetic nervous system whose fibers run on the circumference of the nerve roots of C8, T1, and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus.4 When the nerves are irritated or compressed, the sympathetic fibers are activated, producing Raynaud?s phenomenon. This explains how the coldness and color changes are frequently seen with NTOS. Because the same coldness and color changes also occur in ATOS, differentiating between the two must be done by evaluating other signs and symptoms, which can easily establish the diagnosis.
Physical examination

VTOS is easily identified on physical exam by arm swelling, cyanosis, and distended superficial veins over the shoulder and chest wall.

NTOS and ATOS can be differentiated by physical findings. NTOS usually demonstrates tenderness over the scalene muscles and duplication of symptoms by the following provocative maneuvers:

1

    Neck rotation and head tilting (ear to shoulder), which elicit symptoms of pain and paresthesia down the contralateral side.
2

    Abducting the arms to 90ø in external rotation (90ø AER), which brings on symptoms within 60 seconds and often, in less than 30 seconds.
3

    Modified upper limb tension test of Elvey5 (ULTT). The later test is comparable to straight leg raising in the lower extremity. We were introduced to the ULTT several years ago by Dr Ron Stoney and have found it very helpful in the diagnosis of NTOS. The numbers of positive findings in our last 50 patients are shown in Table II.

    Table II. Positive physical findings in 50 patients

    Scalene M. tenderness	94
    Scalene pressure yields radiating symptoms	92
    Neck rotation to opposite side	90
    Head tilt to opposite side	90
    Sensation to light touch	68

Upper Limb Tension Test of Elvey (ULTT)

We have modified the original test of Elvey by starting with Elvey?s second position, performing the test with the patient sitting up, and executing the maneuvers actively rather than having the examiner perform them passively (Fig). Carrying out the test in this way permits both limbs to be tested simultaneously and permits the asymptomatic side to serve as a control for the symptomatic one. The modified ULTT is performed with three maneuvers in succession as follows (Fig):

Fig. Upper Limb Tension Test (ULTT). Position 1: Arms abducted to 90ø with elbows extended. Position 2: Dorsiflex wrists. Position 3: Tilt head to side, ear to shoulder. Each maneuver progressively increases stretch on the brachial plexus.

Position 1. Abduct both arms to 90ø with the elbows straight.

Position 2. Dorsiflex both wrists.

Position 3. Tilt the head to one side, ear to shoulder. The head is then tilted to the other side. While positions 1 and 2 elicit symptoms on the ipsilateral side, position 3 elicits symptoms on the contralateral side.

Pain down the arm, especially around the elbow, and/or paresthesia in the hand is a positive response. The strongest positive test is onset of symptoms in position 1 with increased symptoms in positions 2 and 3. The weakest response is onset of symptoms only in position 3. In the occasional patient with severe pain at rest, the test can be performed passively by the examiner moving the arm through each position as originally described by Elvey. In his original test, Elvey had an initial first position of abducting the arm to 90ø with the forearm flexed 90ø. Over the years we have found this first position rarely necessary and so we start with Elvey?s second position, which we have relabeled position 1.

A positive ULTT is not pathognomonic of NTOS, rather, it indicates compression against the nerve roots or the branches of the brachial plexus in one of three areas: The thoracic outlet space, pectoralis minor space, or in the cervical spine.

In ATOS, an absent radial pulse at rest is common, as emboli often lodge near the antecubital space. Arm abduction to demonstrate pulse obliteration is seldom necessary. There usually is no scalene muscle tenderness; neck rotation and head tilt elicit no symptoms; and the ULTT may be normal. In ATOS, most of the symptoms are in the hand and forearm, fewer in the shoulder girdle and neck. The diagnosis of ATOS can usually be established with clinical information alone.
Diagnostic procedures
X-ray

A simple x-ray of the chest or neck will easily detect a cervical or anomalous first rib. If there is none, this essentially eliminates ATOS. (Theoretically a tight scalene muscle or ligament could compress the artery, but we have never seen such a case). Even if there is a cervical rib, most symptomatic cervical ribs cause symptoms of neurogenic, not arterial, TOS.
Adson test

In 1927, and again in 1947, Alfred Adson described his now famous test. ?The patient takes a long deep breath, elevates the chin, and turns it to the affected side. This is done as the patient is seated upright, with his arms resting on his knees. An alteration or obliteration of the radial pulse or change in blood pressure is a pathognomonic sign of a scalenus anticus syndrome.?6

Since its original description, Adson?s ?infallible? test has been disputed by several investigators. In 1945, Wright7 noted that pulses could be obliterated by turning the head to either the ipsilateral or contralateral side. In 1965, Woods8 noted that in TOS patients, the Adson test was more often positive when turning the head to the contralateral side (63%) than to the ipsilateral side (22%). In reviewing several reports of patients with NTOS in whom the Adson test was performed, the incidence of positive responses ranged from 22% to 100% with a median of 31%.9

Between 1980 and 1998, four studies of healthy volunteers investigated the effect of postural maneuvers on the radial pulse, including the Adson test.10, 11, 12, 13 Pulse obliteration or reduction of amplitude occurred in 53%, 9%, 15%, and 11%, respectively.
Ninety degree abduction in external rotation stress test (90ø AER)

In 1963, Gilroy and Meyer14 introduced a modification of the Adson test, the 90ø AER maneuver, which is performed by having the patient elevate the arms in a ?stick-em-up? position. This is a provocative test that was popularized by Roos in 196615 and is sometimes referred to as the elevated arm stress test (EAST test of Roos). This test is very helpful in the diagnosis of neurogenic TOS. A positive test is reproduction of the patients? symptoms of pain and paresthesia within 60 seconds but not necessarily reduction of the radial pulse. Our own statistics found that with this maneuver, 94% of NTOS patients had reproduction of symptoms while only 24% demonstrated a diminished pulse.9
Arteriography

The role of arteriography in TOS is a very limited one. The primary purpose of arteriography is to help the surgeon plan arterial reconstruction. It should not be needed to differentiate between arterial and neurogenic compression. This should be done by history and physical exam plus pulse volume recordings and noninvasive duplex scanning when ATOS is under consideration. Arteriography should be employed only when a patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of arterial insufficiency or ischemia and when surgery is under consideration. Duplex scanning often can screen for a subclavian artery aneurysm or stenosis and when such is present, arteriography can then be used to confirm the diagnosis and plan surgical repair. In the absence of these criteria, arteriography is not indicated. When the criteria are met, subclavian abnormalities are usually evident with the arm at rest so that dynamic positioning during arteriography (abducting the arm to 90ø and 180ø) is seldom needed.

Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) does not carry the risks of transfemoral arteriography. Its only risk is the dye itself. However, the same indications should apply to all types of arteriography. MRA is not indicated in NTOS and is simply an unnecessary expense.

Subclavian arteriograms in patients with NTOS will be normal with the arm at the side but some patients will demonstrate subclavian artery compression on dynamic positioning. This finding does not establish a diagnosis of ATOS or NTOS.
Noninvasive vascular lab studies

Arterial pulse reduction with arm elevation can be documented with a pulse volume recorder. However, in patients with symptoms of NTOS, this test is not indicated for the same reason that arteriography is not indicated. Utilizing a vascular sign to diagnose a neurogenic condition is unreliable. Although there is no risk involved with vascular lab studies, it represents an unnecessary study and an unwarranted expense. These are indicated only in patients with clinical findings of ATOS.
Electrodiagnostic testing

Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests are normal in the large majority of patients with clinical signs of NTOS. When positive, the changes are usually nonspecific. In a small number of patients, usually those with cervical ribs and hand atrophy, electrodiagnostic studies reveal typical changes of ulnar neuropathy. This area may be about to change. Recently a study from France was published on the NCV of the sensory medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve.16 Measurements of this nerve revealed abnormalities in clinical NTOS patients in whom all other electrodiagnostic studies were normal. This could prove to be a very helpful objective test to confirm diagnoses that, to date, have been made only by subjective criteria.
Conclusions

1

    The term ?TOS? is not a specific diagnosis. It should be replaced by specifying the appropriate type of TOS before the term, such as neurogenic TOS, arterial TOS, or venous TOS, each of which can be differentiated by appropriate history and physical exam.
2

    The term ?vascular TOS? should be abandoned in favor of a more specific diagnosis.
3

    Adson test is not reliable to either rule in or rule out a diagnosis of neurogenic TOS. It is employing a vascular sign to diagnose a neurologic condition, which frequently is misleading.
4

    The upper limb tension test (ULTT) is comparable to straight leg raising in the lower extremity and is very helpful in the diagnosis of neurogenic TOS.
5

    The purpose of arteriography is to assist the surgeon in planning arterial reconstruction, not to establish a diagnosis.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

ALL SHOULDER girdle compression syndromes have one problem in common1; compression of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery and vein, usually between the clavicle and first rib (Fig 1). Grouping the separate syndromes under the single heading of thoracic outlet syndrome2 has allowed more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be established. Therefore, this syndrome should be considered in all neurologic and vascular complaints of the upper extermities:

1. Scalenus anticus

2. Hyperabduction

3. Costoclavicular

4. Cervical rib

5. Fractured clavicle

6. Cervicobrachial compression

7. Pneumatic hammer

8. Effort vein thrombosis

9. Subcoracoid pectoralis minor

10. First thoracic rib

Symptoms  Symptoms may be grouped into neurologic and vascular complaints. The most common neurologic symptom is aching pain in the side of back of the neck and extending across the shoulder and down the arm. The pain may radiate in all directions from the point of compression. Numbness",GoogleScholar

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is one of the most controversial clinical entities in medicine. We provide a review of this difficult-to-treat disorder, including a brief overview, clinical presentations, surgical anatomy, treatment options, and outcomes.
METHODS:

TOS represents a spectrum of disorders encompassing three related syndromes: compression of the brachial plexus (neurogenic TOS), compression of the subclavian artery or vein (vascular TOS), and the nonspecific or disputed type of TOS. Neurovascular compression may be observed most commonly in the interscalene triangle, but it also has been described in the costoclavicular space and in the subcoracoid space. Patients present with symptoms and signs of arterial insufficiency, venous obstruction, painless wasting of intrinsic hand muscles, paresthesia, and pain. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are the most important diagnostic tools for proper identification of TOS. Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and imaging of the cervical spine and the chest also can provide helpful information regarding diagnosis. Clinical management usually starts with conservative treatment including exercise programs and physical therapy; when these therapies fail, patients are considered for surgery. Two of the most commonly used surgical approaches are the supraclavicular exposure and the transaxillary approach with first rib resection. On occasion, these approaches may be combined or, alternatively, posterior subscapular exposure may be used in selected patients.
CONCLUSION:

TOS is perhaps the most difficult entrapment neuropathy encountered by neurosurgeons. Surgical intervention is indicated for vascular and true neurogenic TOS and for some patients with the common or nonspecific type of TOS in whom nonoperative therapies fail. With careful patient selection, operative intervention usually yields satisfactory results.

Abstract

Personal evaluation of more than 2,300 patients for possible thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and knowledge gained from 980 TOS operations in 766 patients (operative incidence of 33.7 per cent of the patients examined) have shown that most patients with TOS have anomalous fibrous muscular bands near the brachial plexus that predispose them to neurologic irritation or compression involving the plexus. Anatomic analysis during operations for TOS, plus cadaver dissections, have disclosed seven distinct types of fibromuscular bands in addition to the less frequent bony anomalies long associated with neurovascular compression. One third of fifty-eight cadaver thoracic outlets dissected showed at least one of the seven muscular anomalies recognized at operations.

These anomalies can be accurately related to the patients' symptoms, which are neurologic complaints in 99 per cent of the patients examined who ultimately have the diagnosis of TOS established. Neurologic symptoms are clearly explained by the anomalous bands irritating or compressing the brachial plexus and rarely have any effect on the subclavian vessels. These studies, and others before, have shown no correlation with impairment of circulation or positional radial pulse changes in almost all patients with true TOS. Also, arteriograms and nerve conduction studies generally have failed to be of value in establishing the accurate diagnosis. Reasons for these conclusions are explained, and the most reliable tests are described.

The most effective means of relief of severe symptoms of TOS is to alter the mechanical irritation or compression of the brachial plexus by completely resecting the first thoracic rib and all anomalous fibromuscular tissue around the plexus and subclavian vessels. If patients are thoroughly evaluated with appropriate tests and highly selected for surgical treatment, gratifying relief will result in more than 90 per cent of patients, if the correct operation is performed with meticulous technic.

THORACIC-outlet syndrome refers to compression of the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus at the superior aperture of the thorax. It was previously designated according to presumable etiologies such as scalenus anticus, costoclavicular, hyperabduction, cervical rib and first-thoracic-rib syndromes. Wider clinical recognition of this syndrome can be attributed to improved methods of diagnosis and therapy.

The term thoracic outlet syndromes (TOSs) encompasses several diverse clinical disorders (one of dubious validity) involving blood vessels, nerve fibers, or both at various points as they traverse the cervicoaxillary canal. The blood vessels affected may be arteries or veins, subclavian or axillary; the neural structures involved are various portions of the brachial plexus.90

The first classification of the TOSs was provided by Peet and co-workers58 in 1956. It currently has little relevance because it was based on the presumed bony or dynamic factors responsible for the injury, rather than on the particular structure(s) injured. The latter has been the focus of more recent classifications.20, 92 (Table 1). Thus, the TOSs can be subdivided into vascular or neural disorders or both, depending on what specific structures within the cervicoaxillary canal are compromised.

This presentation concerns the three subgroups of TOS in which the brachial plexus is involved, either alone (true neurologic TOS) or with concomitant vascular compromise at times (traumatic TOS; disputed TOS). Those subgroups of TOS that solely affect blood vessels (arterial TOS; venous TOS) are not discussed. The anatomy of the region, being common to all types of TOS, is reviewed first.

Background: Arterial and venous thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) were recognized in the late 1800s and neurogenic TOS in the early 1900s. Diagnosis and treatment of the 2 vascular forms of TOS are generally accepted in all medical circles. On the other hand, neurogenic TOS is more difficult to diagnose because there is no standard objective test to confirm clinical impressions.

Review Summary: The clinical features of arterial, venous, and neurogenic TOS are described. Because neurogenic TOS is by far the most common type, the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnostic tests, differential and associate diagnoses, and treatment are detailed and discussed. The controversial area of objective and subjective diagnostic criteria is addressed.

Conclusion: Arterial and venous TOS are usually not difficult to recognize and the diagnosis can be confirmed by angiography. The diagnosis of neurogenic TOS is more challenging because its symptoms of nerve compression are not unique. The clinical diagnosis relies on documenting several positive findings on physical examination. To date there is still no reliable objective test to confirm the diagnosis, but measurements of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve appear promising.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) refers to disorders attributed to compromise of the neurovascular structures?subclavian/axillary artery and vein, distal cervical roots, brachial plexus fibers?traversing the thoracic outlet.1 Thoracic outlet syndrome can be subdivided into four distinct subgroups, depending on the particular structure affected, because seldom is more than one involved simultaneously.2 These subgroups are arterial vascular, venous vascular, true (or classic) neurologic, and disputed neurologic.3 The first three types are noncontroversial. Because of space limitations the vascular types cannot be discussed in detail; detailed descriptions of them are available.3-6 They share several common features with the true neurologic type (true N-TOS), including characteristic symptom profile, obvious clinical findings, confirmatory results of laboratory studies, worldwide recognition as an entity, and low incidence. For example, true N-TOS is a rare lesion that occurs unilaterally and primarily affects adult women. Caused by the distal C-8/T-1 roots or proximal lower trunk",GoogleScholar

Conservative management of thoracic outlet syndrome is recommended as the initial treatment of choice, and yet few studies have evaluated patient outcome. This study evaluates patient subjective outcome following conservative management of thoracic outlet syndrome. Forty-two patients (37 women, 5 men), mean age 38 years, participated in a telephone questionnaire. Patients clinically diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome who had participated in physical therapy at least 6 months prior to the study were selected. Mean duration of symptoms before treatment was 38 months, and mean follow-up time after therapy was 1 year. Twenty-five patients reported symptomatic improvement, 10 were the same, and 7 had worse symptoms. Sixteen patients reported full work and recreational activities, and 8 patients reported restrictions in both work and recreational activities. Poor overall outcome was related to obesity (p<.04), workers' compensation (p<.04), and associated carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome (p<.04). Neck and shoulder symptoms were improved in 38 patients. Improvement in hand and arm pain was significantly better in those without concomitant distal nerve compression (p<.006).

Opinion statement

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition caused by compression of the neurovascular structures leading to the arm passing through the thoracic outlet. There are three distinct types of TOS: neurogenic (95%), venous (4%?5%), and arterial (1%). Treatment algorithms depend on the type of TOS. Although statistically the most common type, neurogenic TOS can often be the most difficult to diagnose and treat. We have good follow-up data indicating that appropriately selected patients benefit from surgical intervention. Arterial and venous TOS often present more urgently with arterial or venous thrombosis. The thrombosis is typically recognized expeditiously by thorough history taking and physical examination, augmented by duplex ultrasonography. The restoration of blood flow, be it venous or arterial, often can be accomplished readily by thrombolysis. The key, however, comes in diagnosing the underlying structural component involved in the development of symptoms. To prevent recurrence, patients must undergo first rib resection and anterior scalenectomy, as well as resection of any rudimentary or cervical ribs. In the case of arterial TOS, the subclavian artery often requires reconstruction as well. Regardless of the type of TOS encountered, proper treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Opinion statement

The clinical presentation of thoracic outlet syndrome depends on which anatomic structure is compressed in the area of the thoracic outlet (eg, the axillary-subclavian artery, vein [Paget-Schroetter syndrome, or effort thrombosis], brachial plexus, or the sympathetic nerves). The clinical syndrome may be isolated to one or a mixture of these compressed anatomic structures. Although there are multiple compressive forces, the first rib is the common denominator, and extirpation of this structure is the ?gold? standard for therapy. The various syndromes are discussed in their clinical order of frequency. For severe nerve compression, whether upper or lower brachial plexus, the best surgical procedure is the transaxillary first rib resection, anterior scalenectomy, and neurovascular decompression. Axillary-subclavian vein occlusion (ie, Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is best treated with early diagnosis, intravenous thrombolysis of the clot, transaxillary first rib resection anterior scalenectomy, and resection of the costoclavicular ligament. Arterial compression, occlusion, or aneurysm may occur with or without peripheral emboli and require a supraclavicular approach with arterial ligation, endarterectomy, or bypass grafts from the supraclavicular subclavian to the infraclavicular brachial artery. Compression of the sympathetic nerves produces vasospasm, Raynaud?s phenomenon, or Raynaud?s disease, requiring dorsal sympathectomy as well as first rib extirpation occasionally. This may be performed through the transaxillary, supraclavicular posterior, or thoracoscopic approach. Recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome may involve any or all of the above anatomic syndromes. The surgical approach is best from the posterior, high thoracoplasty, muscle-splitting incision, performing neurolysis of the C7, C8, and T1 nerve roots and the brachial plexus as well as release of any vascular constriction.",GoogleScholar

Abstract 
Twelve hundred patients with thoracic outlet syndrome have been managed between 1973 and 1978. Diagnosis was based on a careful history and detailed physical examination designed to establish the presence of brachial plexus irritation. The cervical spine was evaluated and nerve conduction studies were obtained. All patients were initially treated with a comprehensive physical therapy program. One hundred thirteen patients had transaxillary first rib resections. Eighty percent of surgical patients had complete relief of symptoms and 13 percent were improved. Seven percent were unimproved and none was made worse by operation. There were no operative deaths. Complications occurred in 3 percent, and there were no recurrences requiring operation. This management plan reduced the number of patients requiring operation to 9.4 percent while maintaining satisfactory surgical results.",GoogleScholar

Abstract 
During a four year period, 50 patients were evaluated for possible thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). These 11 men and 39 women ranged in age from 27 to 60 years, with a mean age of 38.6 years. Their symptoms had been present from 3 months to 10 years (mean = 2.1 years). Twenty-seven had previously undergone 33 operations, including carpal tunnel release, shoulder arthroscopy, rotator cuff repair, cervical discectomy, and first rib resection, all without benefit. Patients were evaluated by history, physical examination, and radiographs of the cervical spine and chest. Additional studies such as electromyography/nerve conduction studies, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and myelography were obtained selectively. Only 12 patients were thought to have TOS, seven of whom underwent operation. Four had complete resolution of symptoms; three were improved but had residual symptoms for associated problems. Three patients who were not thought to have TOS underwent first rib resection in other hospitals; none was improved after surgery. The only study of positive value was evidence of unilateral subclavian artery compression with shoulder positioning on physical examination. All other studies were of value only if they demonstrated some other cause of the patient's symptoms. Of the 35 patients without TOS in whom long-term follow-up was obtained, four underwent appropriate operations with benefit, and 20 had good results from physical therapy and nonoperative management. Patients whose symptoms were work-related, and those who had engaged the services of a lawyer, were less likely to demonstrate improvement, regardless of the treatment employed. TOS is a relatively unusual cause of upper extremity pain and dysfunction. History and physical examination are the most important diagnostic studies, and radiographs of the chest and cervical spine and electromyography/nerve conduction studies are useful to identify other causes of pain and disability. Careful selection of patients for surgery can yield satisfactory results. A coordinated team of surgeons, neurologists, and physical therapists is important in the management of these patients.",GoogleScholar

Objective

To assess long-term quality of life outcomes in patients following transaxillary first-rib resection and scalenectomy for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).
Methods

This was a prospective observational study using the Short-Form 12 (SF-12) and Disability of Arm, Hand, and Shoulder (DASH) instruments between February 2005 and March 2008 in patients with TOS presenting to an academic medical center for preoperative surgical evaluation after failing physical therapy protocol. Surveys were conducted preoperatively and then again at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. Longitudinal data analysis was performed with population-averaged models using generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for average rate of recovery. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze time to return to work.
Results

A total of 70 out of 105 eligible patients (66.7%) completed the study protocol (44 neurogenic; 26 venous), returning 243 valid SF-12 surveys (162 neurogenic; 81 venous) and 188 valid DASH surveys (124 neurogenic; 64 venous). Half (50%) of the neurogenic patients and 77% of the venous patients returned to full-time work or activity within the study follow-up, with half of them doing so by 4 months and 75% of them by 5 months. There was no statistically significant difference in return to work between the neurogenic or venous patients. Neurogenic patients had baseline SF-12 Physical Component Scores (PCS) similar to chronic heart failure patients and were significantly worse than venous patients (33.8 vs 43.6, P < .001). In contrast, no difference existed in Mental Component Scores (MCS) (44.5 vs 43.5, P = .78). In follow-up, on average, PCS scores for neurogenic patients improved 0.24 points (P < .001) and MCS scores improved 0.15 points per month (P = .01); while PCS scores for venous patients improved 0.40 points (P = .004) and MCS scores improved 0.55 points per month (P < .001). Additionally, neurogenic patients had baseline DASH scores that were similar to patients with rotator cuff tears, and they were also significantly worse than venous patients (50.2 vs 25.0, P < .001). DASH scores, on average, also improved 0.85 points (P < .001) for neurogenic patients and 0.81 points (P < .001) for venous patients per month.
Conclusion

The use of the SF-12 and DASH instruments in patients with TOS demonstrated significant improvement in patients postoperatively. Venous TOS patients typically improved both physical and mental scores in shorter periods of time than their neurogenic counterparts. Neurogenic and venous TOS patients returned to full-time work/activity within the same length of time postoperatively. However, neurogenic patients required more secondary interventions. We conclude that in appropriately selected patients with either neurogenic or venous TOS, surgical intervention can improve their quality of life over time.
Clinical Relevance

Surgical intervention is associated with significant improvement in quality of life for TOS patients. Venous TOS patients improved physical and mental function in shorter time than neurogenic counterparts. The majority of patients were able to return to full-time work or activity by 6 months, while they continued to recover their quality of life. There was no difference in time to return to work or activity between neurogenic and venous patients; however, neurogenic patients required more secondary interventions. In appropriately selected patients with either neurogenic or venous TOS, surgical intervention can improve their quality of life over time.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

The experience with supraclavicular transcervical first rib resection (or cervical rib resection) and total scalenotomy reported herein shows this to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with the thoracic outlet syndrome. We recommend this method as a satisfactory anatomic approach for the correction of this condition. Its advantages are as follows: anatomic structures may be visualized fully by both the surgeon and the assistant; complex or recurrent thoracic outlet problems may be dealt with directly; additional procedures (such as vascular graft, neurolysis, neck exploration, sympathectomy and cervical rib resection) may be performed; the procedure can be done in 90 minutes or less; neither the patient nor the assistant is obliged to assume an awkward or strained position and consequently the likelihood of intraoperative iatrogenic injury is reduced; and neither the period of hospitalization nor the period of immobility is longer than with the other operative techniques currently used for this condition.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

Objective: To evaluate a conservative therapy program that aims to restore normal function to the upper thoracic aperture in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).

Design: A descriptive study of consecutive patients with a positive TOS index seen from 1988 to 1993. After therapy, the patients were followed for a mean period of 24.6 months.

Setting: Therapy was initiated primarily in an inpatient rehabilitation ward over an 11.4-day (range 4?24 days) stay.

Patients: One hundred nineteen patients (28 men and 91 women) with a positive TOS index participated. At admission, 50% of the patients were employed, 48% were on sick leave or retired, and 2% were unemployed.

Interventions: The patients received instructions on how to restore the normal function of their cervical spine and upper thoracic aperture by means of home exercises.

Main Outcome Measures: The efficacy of the treatment program was assessed by the frequency of return to work, normalization of the motion of the cervical spine and upper thoracic aperture, and subjective satisfaction with the outcome.

Results: At the follow-up examination, 88% of the patients were satisfied with the outcome of their treatment, and the ranges of motion of the cervical spine and upper thoracic aperture had normalized in 8 of 10 patients. Seventy-three percent of the patients returned to work after the therapy, either directly or after retraining, and 88% of the patients carried through the recommendations given at discharge during long-term followup. Normalized grip strength and Tinel's sign predicted patient satisfaction (p < .001) and return to work (p < .001). Return to work was more often successful if the work was sedentary rather than heavy (p < .05).

Conclusions: The treatment program provides relief to most patients with symptoms of TOS. If the symptoms are not relieved, the differential diagnosis should be reviewed. Conservative therapy with the aim of restoring the function of the upper thoracic aperture is to be recommended, and long-term follow-up is advisable.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

This overall management program for thoracic outlet compression syndrome is based upon experience with 153 extremities in 149 patients and the results of others. The following conclusions are documented and discussed. 1) Diagnosis is based chiefly upon history; physical signs are inconstant and often absent. 2) Major vascular problems are unusual; angiography is not always necessary. 3) Electromyography is not always critical but does aid in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. 4) Non-operative treatment relieves most patients; operative decompression is indicated for a minority. 5) Transxillary first rib resection, with removal of cervical rib is the best operation. 6) Carpal tunnel decompression should be done concomitantly when needed. 7) Operation is relatively safe.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

Background

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is one of the most controversial diagnoses in clinical medicine. Despite many reports of operative and non?operative interventions, rigorous scientific investigation of this syndrome leading to evidence?based management is lacking. This is the first update of a review first published in 2010.
Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of the available operative and non?operative interventions for the treatment of TOS a minimum of six months after the intervention.
Search methods

On 23 June 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register, CENTRAL, The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and AMED. We also searched reference lists of the identified trials.
Selection criteria

We selected randomized or quasi?randomized studies involving participants with the diagnosis of TOS of any type (neurogenic, vascular, and 'disputed'), without limitations as to language of publication.

We accepted studies that examined any intervention aimed at treating TOS.

The primary outcome measure was change in pain rating, measured on a validated visual analog or similar scale at least six months after the intervention.

The secondary outcomes were change in muscle strength, disability, experiences of paresthesias (numbness and tingling sensations), and adverse effects of the interventions.
Data collection and analysis

Three authors independently selected the trials to be included and extracted data. Authors rated included studies for risk of bias, according to the methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Main results

This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of TOS and had to rely exclusively on the diagnosis of TOS by the investigators in the reviewed studies. We identified one study comparing natural progression with an active intervention. We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but only two of them had a follow?up of six months or more, which was the minimum required follow?up for inclusion in the review. The first trial that met our requirements involved 55 participants with the 'disputed type' of TOS and compared transaxillary first rib resection (TFRR) with supraclavicular neuroplasty of the brachial plexus (SNBP). The trial had a high risk of bias. TFRR decreased pain more than SNBP. There were no adverse effects in either group. The second trial that met these requirements analyzed 37 people with TOS of any type, comparing treatment with a botulinum toxin (BTX) injection into the scalene muscles with a saline placebo injection. This trial had a low risk of bias. There was no significant effect of treatment with the BTX injection over placebo in terms of pain relief or improvements in disability, but it did significantly improve paresthesias at six months' follow?up. There were no adverse events of the BTX treatment above saline injection.
Authors' conclusions

This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of TOS. There was very low quality evidence that transaxillary first rib resection decreased pain more than supraclavicular neuroplasty, but no randomized evidence that either is better than no treatment. There is moderate evidence to suggest that treatment with BTX injections yielded no great improvements over placebo injections of saline. There is no evidence from RCTs for the use of other currently used treatments. There is a need for an agreed definition for the diagnosis of TOS, especially the disputed form, agreed outcome measures, and high quality randomized trials that compare the outcome of interventions with no treatment and with each other.",GoogleScholar

Summary

Treatment of the thoracic outlet patient can be a complex and challenging problem for the occupational or physical therapist. The literature supports conservative care as the preferred approach for these patients; therefore, therapy plays an important role in caring for these patients. I question whether TOS is becoming the RDS of the 1990s. Often these ?TOS? patients are suffering from additional secondary system complaints including active myofascial trigger points, primary or secondary glenohumeral joint pathologies, cervical pathology, or more distal peripheral neuropathies.

A thorough evaluation by the therapist is extremely important in determining TOS and separating compressive TOS from entrapment TOS. It is only after a thorough assessment that a proper treatment approach can be formulated. Treatment should initially address comfort, control, and relief and then progress to the neurovascular component. Finally, strengthening and conditioning, if tolerated, are implemented. Properly educating the patient to achieve behavior modification, exercise compliance, symptom control, and postural correction is requisite to optimal results.",GoogleScholar

    Abstract
    Author Information

The manifestations of thoracic outlet syndrome vary according to which of the neurovascular structures are affected. To provide optimal treatment, the pathogenesis must be understood in terms of both the anatomic variants and the dynamic factors. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although ancillary diagnostic studies are useful in selected patients. Following a careful examination, the orthopaedic surgeon should be able to initiate a program of appropriate therapy depending on the nature and severity of the clinical manifestations. Initial treatment is oriented toward postural reeducation and periscapular muscle strengthening. Glenohumeral instabilities and painful upper-limb conditions that cause disuse atrophy must be addressed. Operative treatment is reserved for patients in whom a conservative program has failed and for those with significant neural or vascular deficits. The surgeon must be cognizant of the potential complications of the various procedures used to correct thoracic outlet syndrome. Proper selection of surgical candidates should produce significant improvement in most patients.",GoogleScholar

Abstract

A series of physical therapy protocols is proposed for patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. The anatomic findings dictating certain physical therapeutic approaches are outlined. General principles of physical therapy that stem from these findings are suggested, and a specific protocol for the physical therapy regimen is given. An appropriate physical therapy program for thoracic outlet syndrome patients with symptoms of mild-to-moderate severity can avoid early surgery. Degradation of symptoms or invalidating functional compromise indicates a referral to surgery. Physical therapy cannot replace surgery in severe or complicated forms of thoracic outlet syndrome with vascular or neurologic compromise.",GoogleScholar

Abstract
PURPOSE:

First rib resection is a key component of the treatment of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS). We report our experience with, and technique for, robotic first rib resection.
METHODS:

Patients diagnosed with TOS underwent robotic first rib resection of the offending portion of the first rib with disarticulation of the costo-sternal joint. Definitive diagnosis of TOS was made by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) with maneuvers.
RESULTS:

A total of 67 patients underwent robotic first rib resection. Neurogenic TOS: 39 patients underwent robotic resection for Neurologic Symptoms of the upper extremity (Neurogenic TOS). There were 14 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 34 ñ 9.5 years. Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) or Venous TOS: 28 patients underwent transthoracic robotic first rib resection for PSS. There were 16 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 24 ñ 8.5 years. Operative time was 87.6 ñ 10.8 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 days with a median hospitalization of 3 days. There were no neurovascular complications. There was no mortality. In patients with Neurogenic TOS, QuickDASH Scores (mean ñ SEM) decreased from 60.3 ñ 2.1 preoperatively to 5 ñ 2.3 in the immediate postoperative period and to 3.5 ñ 1.1 at 6 months (p<0001). Immediate relief of symptoms was seen in 35/39 patients (91%). Persistent paresthesia was seen in 4/39 (9%) immediately postop, and in 2/39 (2.5%) at 6 months. Thirty-seven of 39 (97.5%) patients reported complete relief of symptoms. Among patients with PSS or Venous TOS, 9/28 (32%) required endovascular venoplasty to completely open the subclavian vein after the relief of extrinsic compression. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients with PSS had an open subclavian vein, for a patency rate of 100%.
CONCLUSIONS:

Robotic transthoracic first rib resection allows for minimally invasive resection of the first rib in patients with TOS, with excellent relief of symptoms and no neurovascular complications.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Thoracic outlet syndrome is an important clinical entity, which usually affects young patients and working cohort, causing disability if unrecognized and untreated. Although treatment is commonly conservative, in patients with more severe disease, surgical treatment is often required for decompression. Purpose of this paper was to evaluate the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent first rib resection through transaxillary approach for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) during a period of 30 years.
METHODS:

A retrospective study was conducted on a prospectively compiled, computerized database between January 1988 and December 2018 including patients affected by TOS surgically treated in two Italian centers, by the same surgeon. Patients with neurogenic and vascular TOS were included in the present analysis. The surgical approach for TOS decompression was the first rib resection using the Roos' transaxillary approach, with small variations in technique. Outcome measures considered for analysis were primary technical success, 30-day and mean follow-up re-intervention, pneumothorax, nerve injury and symptoms recurrence rates.
RESULTS:

103 patients were treated: 89 (86.4 %) women and 14 (13.6 %) man; median age was 32.6ñ10.2 years (range 9-53). Prominent symptoms were neurogenic in 60 patients (58.2%), venous in 32 (31.1 %), and arterial in 11 (7.76%) patients. In 49 patients (47.5%) with prominent neurogenic symptoms, concomitant symptoms of vascular TOS were also presents. Thirteen (12.6%) patients had cervical rib and sixteen cases (15.5%) had bilateral TOS. Technical success was achieved in all cases, and no other surgical access or secondary approach was necessary. Three patients (2.9%) presented with hand ischemia and also needed an arm vein bypass after rib resection. One (0.9%) intraoperative arterial injury was reported and nerve injury rate was 1.8%. At 30-day re-intervention rate was 0.9%: one patient experienced hemothorax solved by thoracoscopic drainage. Restrict pneumothorax was reported in 42 patients (40.8%) treated through pleural drainage. At mean follow-up of (93ñ9 months) partial symptoms recurrence was present in 6 patients (5.8%).
CONCLUSIONS:

In our experience first rib resection trough the transaxillary approach is a safe and feasible procedure associated with an acceptable rate of peri-operative morbidity and satisfactory long-term relief of symptoms.",PubMed

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

We examined the role of botulinum toxin (BTX) injections of anterior scalene (AS) and pectoralis minor (PM) muscles in patients undergoing surgery for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS). We hypothesized that symptomatic improvement from BTX injections correlates with favorable long-term response to surgery for NTOS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant study was approved by the institutional review board and prior informed consent requirement was waived. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively acquired data in NTOS patients who underwent sonographically guided chemodenervation of AS and PM using BTX type A followed by scalenectomy and first rib resection. Overall responses to BTX injections and surgery were recorded after each procedure. Statistical analyses were performed to determine correlation between responses to BTX injections and surgery.
RESULTS:

In 157 patients, 178 BTX injections followed by surgery were identified (114 females; mean age 38 ñ 13 years). Responders and non-responders to BTX injections and surgery had similar preoperative symptom duration and age (P > 0.14). Better response to BTX injections correlated positively with better response to surgery (P = 0.003), persisting after adjustment for age, gender, and symptom duration (P = 0.03). A high proportion of responders to BTX injections also responded to surgery (positive predictive value of 99%), and BTX injections showed high specificity (90%). BTX injections were moderately sensitive (66%) and accurate (67%) to determine surgical response and had low negative predictive value (14%).
CONCLUSION:

Response to BTX injections correlates positively with long-term surgical outcome in subjects with NTOS, potentially playing an important role in patient management.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To determine if using a telephone can induce forearm pain and ischemia.
DESIGN:

Prospective case-control trial.
SETTING:

Vascular laboratory in the university hospital in Angers between September 2018 and March 2019.
PARTICIPANTS:

Fifteen apparently healthy subjects (controls) and 32 patients with suspected thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) of vascular or non-vascular origin.
INTERVENTION:

Hand-holding a cellular phone to answer a call from investigators.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Presence of forearm fatigue or pain (primary outcome), ability to hold the phone with each hand for 1 min (secondary outcome 1) and decrease in forearm transcutaneous oxygen pressure DROP index indicating forearm ischemia (secondary outcome 2). A DROP < -15 mm Hg defined ischemia.
RESULTS:

Answering a phone call resulted in 25(78%) patients with forearm fatigue or pain and in 18 (56%) cases in the inability to hold the phone for 1 min, on one or both arms in patients with suspected TOS, but never occurred in healthy volunteers (p < .05 and p < .001). The presence of ischemia was observed in one or both arms in 10 (31%) patients with proved TOS and was always associated to phone-induced pain. Three (20%) of the controls had phone-induced ischemia. All had asymptomatic TOS and remained asymptomatic during the phone test (p = .42 from suspected-TOS patients).
CONCLUSION:

The phone conversation resulted in pain in many patients with suspected TOS. Transcutaneous oximetry can document the underlying ischemia. Forearm phone-call-induced pain may be indicative of TOS provided that no earplug or headset is used. Trial registrationClinicalTrials.govNCT03355274.",PubMed

Background: Pectoralis minor syndrome (PMS) develops when the neurovascular bundle compression occurs at the retropectoralis minor space. It may occur due to repetitive overhead activities, traumatic incident, structural causes, myofascial pain syndrome in the pectoralis minor muscle, as well as spasticity of the pectoralis minor muscle. In patients with hemiplegia, adductor muscles along with pectoralis minor muscle spasticity may be present in the upper extremity.Objective: We report a 19-year-old male patient with spastic hemiparesis who was diagnosed with PMS due to spasticity of the pectoralis minor muscle.Method: Diagnosis of PMS was confirmed by Ultrasound-guided 4 cc 1% lidocaine injection to the right pectoralis minor muscle and Ultrasound-guided onabotulinum toxin A injection was performed. Stretching exercises to the pectoral muscles were also added to the rehabilitation program.Result: Complaints of the patient were controlled by botulinum toxin injections at 3-month intervals.Conclusion: It should be kept in mind that spasticity in the upper extremity may develop in the pectoralis minor muscle, and may cause pressure on the neurovascular structures. Ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injections can be a safe and effective treatment for PMS in a patent with post stroke spastic hemiparesis.

Abstract
RATIONALE:

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) secondary to subclavian arterial stent implantation is extremely rare. Here, we firstly report this disease and the endovascular intervention using covered-stents.
PATIENT CONCERNS:

An 80-year-old man who had received an acceptable stent implantation for the treatment of a right subclavian arteriovenous malformation (AVM), presented with a gradually increasing swelling and pain in his right upper extremity.
DIAGNOSIS:

The patient was diagnosed with right VTOS and recurrent subclavian AVM following ultrasonography and computed tomographic angiography.
INTERVENTIONS:

We positioned a covered-stent in the subclavian artery to block the feeding arteries and successfully embolized the remaining branches with coils. Next, we performed successful dilation 3 times, followed by the positioning of another covered-stent in the right subclavian vein.
OUTCOMES:

The patient was free of all symptoms and the imaging procedures confirmed an acceptable thrombosis of the AVM with patent stents in the right subclavian artery and vein during the 6-month follow-up.
LESSONS:

Venous stent implantation is an alternative to treat VTOS caused by subclavian arterial stents and it is essential to pay more attention to the incidence of VTOS following arterial stent implantation in the subclavian artery.",PubMed

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To assess the utilization and consequences of upper extremity Duplex ultrasound in the initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected subclavian vein (SCV) thrombosis and venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS).
METHODS:

A retrospective single-center review was conducted for patients that underwent primary surgical treatment for VTOS between 2008 and 2017, in whom an upper extremity ultrasound had been performed as the initial diagnostic test (n = 214). Clinical and treatment characteristics were compared between patients with positive and false-negative ultrasound studies.
RESULTS:

There were 122 men (57%) and 92 women (43%) that had presented with spontaneous idiopathic arm swelling, including 28 (13%) with proven pulmonary embolism, at a mean age of 30.7 ñ 0.8 years (range 14-69). Upper extremity ultrasound had been performed 23.8 ñ 12.2 days after the onset of symptoms, with confirmation of axillary-SCV thrombosis in 169 patients (79%) and negative results in 45 (21%). Of the false-negative ultrasound study reports, only 8 (18%) acknowledged limitations in visualizing the central SCV. Definitive diagnostic imaging (DDI) had been obtained by upper extremity venography in 175 (82%), computed tomography angiography in 24 (11%), and magnetic resonance angiography in 15 (7%), with 142 (66%) undergoing catheter-directed axillary-SCV thrombolysis. The mean interval between initial ultrasound and DDI was 48.9 ñ 14.2 days with no significant difference between groups, but patients with a positive ultrasound were more likely to have DDI within 48 hours than those with a false-negative ultrasound (44% vs 24%; P = .02). At the time of surgical treatment, the SCV was widely patent following paraclavicular decompression and external venolysis alone in 74 patients (35%). Patch angioplasty was performed for focal SCV stenosis in 76 (36%) and bypass graft reconstruction for long-segment axillary-SCV occlusion in 63 (29%). Patients with false-negative initial ultrasound studies were significantly more likely to require SCV bypass reconstruction than those with a positive ultrasound (44% vs 25%; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS:

Duplex ultrasound has significant limitations in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected SCV thrombosis, with false-negative results in 21% of patients with proven VTOS. This is rarely acknowledged in ultrasound reports, but false-negative ultrasound studies have the potential to delay definitive imaging, thrombolysis, and further treatment for VTOS. Initial false-negative ultrasound results are associated with progressive thrombus extension and a more frequent need for SCV bypass reconstruction at the time of surgical treatment.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is challenging to diagnose, as the physical findings and investigations lack sensitivity and/or specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with dynamic manoeuvres can rule out a tumour and detect anatomical abnormalities potentially responsible for compression. The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for identifying anatomical structures responsible for compression in TOS, using intra-operative findings as the diagnostic reference standard.
HYPOTHESIS:

MRI is effective in diagnosing the source of compression in TOS, notably within the scalene triangle and at the pleural apex.
METHODS:

We retrospectively included 48 patients who underwent surgery for TOS after a work-up that included MRI (1.5-T, n=29 and 3-T, n=19). The MRI scans were reviewed for the study by a specialised radiologist who was unaware of the intra-operative findings. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosing TOS were estimated using the intra-operative findings as the reference standard.
RESULTS:

MRI identified a structure potentially responsible for TOS in 34 (71%) patients; thus, the false-negative rate was 14/48 (29%). The sensitivity of MRI was 28% for compression at the suspensory ligament of the pleural dome, 81% for hypertrophy of the anterior scalene muscle, and 50% for an accessory scalene muscle. For diagnosing a cervical rib, MRI had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
CONCLUSION:

MRI can contribute to the diagnosis of TOS. Specificity is sufficiently high to provide guidance for planning the surgical procedure. Sensitivity, however, is too low for MRI to be useful as a screening test. MRI should be used in combination with the clinical assessment and other investigations to assist in the diagnosis of TOS.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

The effectiveness of blood flow restriction training (BFRT) as compared with other forms of training, such as resistance training, has been evaluated in the literature in clinical and nonclinical populations. However, the safety of this intervention has been summarized only in healthy populations and not in clinical populations with musculoskeletal disorders.
PURPOSE:

To evaluate the safety and adverse events associated with BFRT in patients with musculoskeletal disorders.
STUDY DESIGN:

Systematic review.
METHODS:

A literature search was conducted with 3 online databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies were as follows: (1) BFRT was used as a clinical intervention, (2) study participants had a disorder of the musculoskeletal system, (3) authors addressed adverse events, (4) studies were published in English, and (5) the intervention was performed with human participants.
RESULTS:

Nineteen studies met eligibility criteria, with a pooled sample size of 322. Diagnoses included various knee-related disorders, inclusion body myositis, polymyositis or dermatomyositis, thoracic outlet syndrome, Achilles tendon rupture, and bony fractures. Nine studies reported no adverse events, while 3 reported rare adverse events, including an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and rhabdomyolysis. Three case studies reported common adverse events, including acute muscle pain and acute muscle fatigue. In the randomized controlled trials, individuals exposed to BFRT were not more likely to have an adverse event than individuals exposed to exercise alone. Of the 19 studies, the adverse events were as follows: overall, 14 of 322; rare overall, 3 of 322; rare BFRT, 3 of 168; rare control, 0 of 154; any adverse BFRT, 10 of 168; any adverse control, 4 of 154. A majority of studies were excluded because they did not address safety.
CONCLUSION:

BFRT appears to be a safe strengthening approach for knee-related musculoskeletal disorders, but further research is needed to make definitive conclusions and to evaluate the safety in other musculoskeletal conditions. Improved definitions of adverse events related to BFRT are needed to include clear criteria for differentiating among common, uncommon, and rare adverse events. Finally, further research is needed to effectively screen who might be at risk for rare adverse events.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a condition that is both complex to diagnose and manage successfully. The aim of our study was to present our experience and outcomes of surgical management of thoracic outlet syndrome in adolescents.
METHODS:

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively held database of consecutive adolescents (age 10-19 years) who underwent surgery for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome between 2005 and 2017 at our university hospital.
RESULTS:

Fourteen patients were identified (19 operations), with a mean age of 16.5 years (SD: 1.9). All patients had symptomatic relief with surgery with low complication rates (1 pneumothorax). Median hospital stay was 2 days (IQR: 1). There were no early recurrences but 5 late ones which occurred 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 10 years after surgery (20%). None required a second procedure and were managed successfully with physiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS:

Surgical intervention for thoracic outlet syndrome in the adolescent population results in excellent outcomes in the short term. However, we found that recurrence of symptoms in this population is common and patients need to be counseled clearly about this prior to surgical intervention. However in our experience these do not require further surgery.",PubMed

Abstract

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to introduce a novel method combining contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA), short inversion time inversion recovery sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (T2-STIR-SPACE) and volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequences in the assessment of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). MATERIAL AND METHODS CE-MRA, T2-STIR-SPACE, and VIBE techniques were employed to evaluate neurovascular bundles in 27 patients clinically suspected of TOS. Images were evaluated to determine the cause of neurovascular bundle compression. Surgical exploration was performed in patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. RESULTS Twenty patients were found to be abnormal: 6 cases showed only neurogenic TOS and the correlates included infraclavicular hemangiomas (n=1) and transverse cervical artery (n=5). Arterial-neurogenic TOS was found in 4 cases, including subclavian lymph node metastasis from breast cancer (n=3) and schwannoma (n=1). Arterial-venous-neurogenic TOS was found in 1 subject, and the correlates included a fibrous band from the cervical rib and elongated C7 transverse process. In this case, the subclavian artery/vein was compressed dynamically. Venous-neurogenic TOS was noted in one subject. Nine patients were considered as post-traumatic TOS, including brachial plexus edema (n=3), the brachial plexus rupture (n=2), peri-brachial plexus effusion (n=3), and stenosis of the SCA (n=1). In the remaining 7 patients, MRI did not detect abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS TOS can be evaluated by CE-MRA, T2-STIR-SPACE, and VIBE during a single examination, with a reduced contrast material dose. This imaging modality performs well in showing the anatomical structure of the neurovascular bundle and the cause of the compression.",PubMed

Abstract

Imaging is needed for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of patients with pathologies affecting upper extremity vasculature. With growth and evolution of imaging modalities [especially CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA)], there is need to recognize the advantages and disadvantages of various modalities and obtain the best possible imaging diagnostic test. Understanding various limitations and pitfalls as well as the best practices to minimize and manage these pitfalls is very important for the diagnosis. This article reviews the upper extremity arterial vascular anatomy, discusses the CTA and MRA imaging, various pitfalls, and challenges and discuss imaging manifestations of upper extremity arterial pathologies.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Rib resection in venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) may be approached via a transaxillary, supraclavicular, or infraclavicular approach based on surgeon preference. The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term postoperative quality of life function after surgery for vTOS and to determine if there were long-term patency differences associated with the surgical approach or whether prophylactic postoperative venography was performed.
METHODS:

All patients with vTOS undergoing rib resection at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. In 2012, we switched our approach to infraclavicular with postoperative venogram performed within 2 weeks of rib resection. Clinical records and imaging results were tabulated, and postoperative outcomes, complications, and long-term symptom follow up via the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand score surveys. The disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand score ranges from 0 to 100 with lower numbers indicating better functional status (100 = worst).
RESULTS:

During the 19-year study period, we performed 109 rib resections in patients with vTOS (mean age, 29.8 years). From 2000 to 2012, 54 patients were approached via a supraclavicular approach, and from 2012 to 2018, 55 patients were approached via an infraclavicular approach. There was a significant decrease in the number of complications in the infraclavicular cohort compared with the supraclavicular group. There was no difference in patency between the 2 groups even with a higher rate of postoperative venogram in the infraclavicular cohort. There was no difference in long-term the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores. There was an increased rate of complications in the supraclavicular cohort as compared with the infraclavicular group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:

The infraclavicular approach in patients with vTOS is associated with a lower rate of complications, but long-term quality of life outcomes and patency are not different between groups.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

No validated scales exist specifically for measuring quality of life (QoL) and functioning level in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). This cross-sectional survey examined whether some items adopted from validated QoL scales could be suitable for patients with TOS.
METHODS:

To find an optimal thoracic outlet syndrome index (TOSI), a panel of 14 specialists experienced in treating TOS independently evaluated the relevance of 19 items adopted from scales used in other upper-extremity syndromes. After undergoing surgery for TOS, 52 patients rated the relevance of those items found by experts to be relevant. Content validity was measured by a content validity index, content validity ratio, and modified ?. The internal consistency of 15 retained items was assessed with the Cronbach à, and its construct validity was assessed by an exploratory factor analysis.
RESULTS:

Of the 19 items, 15 were considered relevant for TOS by the panelists, with an overall test content validity index of 0.93. The internal consistency of these 15 items was excellent. The exploratory factor analysis accompanied by a parallel analysis confirmed the uni-dimensionality of the TOSI. All 15 items that the panelists considered relevant were also items that the patients marked with scores over 7 points on an 11-point scale of relevance.
CONCLUSION:

The internally consistent, face- and content-valid TOSI scale is proposed for use in evaluating specifically the QoL in TOS patients, as well as improving future longitudinal studies comparing functioning before and after interventions or spontaneous recovery in TOS patients.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

Traditional management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) has involved catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) followed by transaxillary or paraclavicular (PC) first rib resection. More recently, we have adopted an infraclavicular (IC) approach for first rib resection and five other strategies to treat these patients. We report our evolving experience with the treatment of acute VTOS.
METHODS:

We reviewed our prospectively maintained database to identify patients treated for VTOS. Our strategy includes CDT with pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, IC first rib resection during the same hospitalization, and subclavian vein angioplasty immediately after rib resection. Postoperatively, a sequential compression device was applied to the affected arm and low-dose heparin given through the ipsilateral venous sheath. Antiplatelet therapy was given for 6 weeks and anticoagulation for 6 months. Our strategy evolved from a PC to an IC approach, given that the added morbidity of the supraclavicular approach to allow excision of the posterior portion of the rib may add no benefit with VTOS compared with arterial or neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.
RESULTS:

There were 51 patients who underwent first rib resection for VTOS, 11 (22%) through a PC approach and 40 (78%) through an IC approach. The average age was 36 years (range, 16-63 years), and the majority were female (36 [71%]) and involved the right subclavian vein (36 [71%]). All patients underwent preoperative CDT, 40 (78%) at our hospital and 11 (22%) elsewhere. Fifty patients (98%) underwent subclavian vein angioplasty after rib resection. A bare-metal stent was placed in two (4%) patients for persistent stenosis. Average length of stay was 3.7 (ñ2.1) days. Average operative time was 2.2 hours (range, 1.5-3.0 hours) when the IC approach was used vs 3.5 hours (range, 2.5-4.5 hours) for the PC approach (P < .0001). Of the entire group, one (2.6%) patient required reoperation for wound hematoma and six (12%) patients underwent repeated endovascular intervention for recurrent vein stenosis during follow-up (average, 38 months; range, 1-240 months). Primary and assisted primary patency rates at 3 years were 78% and 100%, respectively. There were no significant differences in patency rates or complications between the IC and PC approaches.
CONCLUSIONS:

Our transition to an IC approach demonstrated low perioperative morbidity and excellent subclavian vein patency rates with shorter operative times compared with a PC approach. Our practice has evolved to include IC first rib resection followed by concomitant postoperative venous balloon angioplasty.

Abstract

Brachial plexus compression is a rare complication of displaced clavicle fractures, with few reports existing in the literature. Neurologic symptoms can present immediately after the injury or in a delayed fashion months later. Following polytrauma, two patients presented with displaced middle-third left clavicle fractures initially treated conservatively at other institutions. Both patients developed neurologic symptoms in the left upper extremity consistent with brachial plexus compression. Magnetic resonance imaging and electrodiagnostic testing were used to help confirm the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome/brachial plexopathy, and both patients underwent open reduction internal fixation with dual plating, local bone grafting and brachial plexus decompression. Both patients experienced successful relief of neurologic symptoms postoperatively. The purpose of this case series is to report on a rare complication of delayed- and non-united clavicle fractures and describe successful treatment with a novel fracture fixation construct.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

A clinical, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial with two parallel groups.
OBJECTIVE:

to evaluate the efficacy of ropivacaine injection in each belly of the anterior and middle scalene muscles, guided by ultrasonography, in the treatment of Nonspecific Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) compared to cutaneous pressure.
METHODS:

38 patients, 19 in the control group (skin pressure in each belly of the anterior and middle scalene muscles) and 19 in the intervention group (ropivacaine). Subjects with a diagnosis of Nonspecific Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, pain in upper limbs and/or neck, with no radiculopathy or neurological involvement of the limb affected due to compressive or encephalic root causes were included. The primary endpoint was functionality, evaluated by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand - DASH scale validated for use in Brasil. The time of the evaluations were T0 = before the intervention; T1 = immediately after; T2 = 1 week; T3 = 4 weeks; T4 = 12 weeks; for T1, the DASH scale was not applied.
RESULTS:

Concerning the DASH scale, it is possible to affirm with statistical significance (p> 0.05) that the intervention group presented an improvement of functionality at four weeks, which was maintained by the 12th week.
CONCLUSION:

In practical terms, we concluded that a 0.375% injection of ropivacaine at doses of 2.5 ml in each belly of the anterior and middle scalene muscles, guided by ultrasonography, in the treatment of Nonspecific Thoracic Outlet Syndrome helps to improve function.",PubMed

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

True neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TN-TOS) is an extremely rare neuromuscular disease. We report clinical, electrodiagnostic and radiologic features of patients with TN-TOS.
METHODS:

Retrospective chart review of patients satisfying criteria was done. Nerve conduction study (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) of upper extremity were reviewed. Brachial plexus MRI and computed tomography angiography (CTA) were also reviewed.
RESULTS:

Thirteen TN-TOS patients were identified. The most common neurologic signs were hypesthesia in the medial forearm or ulnar digits and weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. In NCS, medial antebrachial cutaneous (MABC) sensory nerve action potential amplitude was decreased in all tested patients. The APB muscle was most commonly involved in EMG. Among radiologic criteria, focal stenosis of subclavian artery in CTA was the most common finding.
CONCLUSION:

We confirmed that TN-TOS is T1 predominant lower roots/trunk brachial plexopathy with clinical and electrodiagnostic features. Radiologic studies may be used to detect structural abnormalities.
SIGNIFICANCE:

As MABC NCS showed abnormal results in all tested patients, it should be added to electrodiagnostic study as screening method. If present, structural abnormalities might be confirmed with radiologic studies.

Abstract

Circumscapular pain is a frequent complaint in clinical practice. The dorsal scapular and long thoracic nerves course through the neck, where they may become entrapped between or within adjacent scalene muscles. Additionally, a high frequency of brachial plexus ""piercing"" variants have recently been documented, and it is unclear how they influence branching patterns distally along the brachial plexus. In the project reported here we strived to identify and quantify variations in dorsal scapular nerve and long thoracic nerve secondary to brachial plexus piercing variation. Ninety brachial plexuses from human cadavers (45 female/45 male) were evaluated to identify nerve branching patterns, specifically piercing versus non-piercing variants in the brachial plexus roots and nerves. Anatomical entrapment of the dorsal scapular nerve and long thoracic nerve was found in high frequencies (60.8% and 44.6%, respectively). Anomalous brachial plexus piercing variants were associated with higher frequencies of distal nerve branches also coursing through the scalene musculature, and there was a statistically significant correlation between brachial plexus and long thoracic nerve piercings (p?=?0.027). Anatomical entrapment of nerves within scalene musculature is common and may be causative factors for idiopathic circumscapular pain, dorsalgia, and dysfunction of scapulohumeral rhythm. This study revealed a link between anatomical arrangement of the brachial plexus and occurrence of long thoracic nerve entrapment, which may lead to a series of cascading neurologic effects in which affected individuals may suffer from increased incidence of thoracic outlet syndrome and long thoracic nerve entrapment resulting in additional symptoms of interscapular pain and compromised shoulder mobility.

"Anatomy, Head and Neck, Inter-scalene Triangle

Introduction

The inter-scalene triangle is a region of the neck that holds fundamental structures to upper extremity function. The triangle is composed of two muscles and the first rib. The two neck muscles are the anterior and middle scalenes. The angle between the muscles can be as little as zero degrees, which can lead to complications. Regardless, this triangle is integral for upper extremity anesthesia because it identifies the location of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is the source of the nerves of the rest of the arm and is fundamental in the extremity?s functionality. Issues with this plexus, specifically at the level of the inter-scalene triangle, can be detrimental to the quality of life of a patient; these issues are otherwise known collectively as thoracic outlet syndrome. Other problems can occur with the vascular structures of the triangle, specifically the subclavian artery and the neighboring subclavian vein. Occlusions can lead to aneurysms and weakness of the arm.[1]
Go to:
Structure and Function

The triangle is made up of two muscles and the first rib. The anterior side of the triangle is created by the anterior scalene, while the middle scalene forms the posterior side of the triangle.[2] The anterior and middle scalene allow for flexion of the cervical spine. These muscles are also accessory muscles of respiration when the cervical spine is stationary; this is possible because of their insertion onto the first and second ribs. This triangle is not classically known for its respiratory functionality, regardless of this its insertion onto the first two ribs allow for this important physiological mechanism of life.[1]
Go to:
Embryology

Neck muscles, like the anterior and middle scalenes, are derived from the embryonic mesoderm.[3]
Go to:
Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The subclavian artery and vein are at the base of the inter-scalene triangle.[1] The subclavian artery passes directly through the triangle with the brachial plexus, while the vein remains at the lower border.[4] Compression of these vascular structures can lead to weakness, numbness, and vascular compromise.[5]
Go to:
Nerves

Near the inter-scalene angle, located at the upper part of the triangle, lay the anterior rami of the third through fifth cervical spinal nerves. The base of the triangle is the location of the brachial plexus.[1] The plexus is involved with motor and sensory function of the shoulder down to the fingertips. Injuries to this plexus can lead to significant deficits in quality of life.[6] Oblique to the anterior scalene and passing anteriorly to the subclavian artery is the phrenic nerve. The phrenic nerve controls the diaphragmatic muscles for breathing.[7] Although the phrenic nerve is not within the triangle, it is similar to the subclavian vein in that because of its relative location to the triangle; it is easily prone to compromise. Another associated nerve is the long thoracic nerve. One of its anterior branches, specifically C7, crosses within the triangle. This nerve becomes subcutaneous near the first and second rib and innervates the serratus anterior muscle.[8]
Go to:
Muscles

The two muscles that form the triangle include the anterior and middle scalenes, while the structure creating the base is the first rib (which is actually the insertion point for both muscles). The anterior scalene arises from the transverse processes of the anterior tubercles of C3 to C6. The middle scalene arises from the transverse processes of the posterior tubercles of C2 to C7.[1]
Go to:
Physiologic Variants

Some variations of the anterior scalenes include origin from C2 to C6, or C3 to C5, or insertion into the second or third rib. And some variations of the middle scalene include an origin from C1 (the atlas) and like the anterior scalene, inserting onto the second rib.[1] In some patients, the scalenes (specifically the anterior scalene) may become hypertrophied, which can contribute to future aneurysmal changes of the subclavian artery.[9]
Go to:
Surgical Considerations

The anterior and middle scalene insertions on the first rib can vary, which creates a narrow space. Because of this, the subclavian artery and brachial plexus can be higher than normal in position, which is important to consider during incisions. Also, in some patients, the middle scalene can insert across the full length of the first rib. In some rare cases, the middle and anterior scalenes have fused, so the artery and plexus having to pierce through the muscular sheath. The muscles are not the only variants that can occur. The first rib can have structural anomalies that narrow the space, including fusion of ribs, abnormal positioning, and a healed fracture. All variations can make the structures harder to visualize and would dictate further treatment, whether surgical or non-surgical.[4]
Go to:
Clinical Significance

After surgeries in general, nerve blocks are often used to decrease the pain that an individual may be experiencing. An inter-scalene nerve block has been an option specifically in many upper extremity injuries.[10] Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a common complication due to abnormal anatomical locations and injuries. Some sites most often affected include the inter-scalene triangle, the costoclavicular space, and the retro pectoralis minor space).[5] This syndrome is notorious for lacking a specific clinical presentation.[11] In general, the neurovascular structures in the triangle undergo compression.[5] The compression of the subclavian artery is more diagnostic of TOS than compressing the subclavian vein because vein compression can occur in non-TOS patients.[11] Diagnostic testing for this condition includes maneuvers in clinic and imaging (MRI, CT, X-ray).[5] Different criteria can be used to help diagnose TOS. Some of these criteria include weakness or pain in the upper body and face, tenderness of the anterior or middle scalene, positive Tinel sign, positive neck tilt test, and positive costoclavicular compression test.[12]
Go to:
Other Issues

Treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome can be via scalenectomy for upper thoracic outlet syndrome, and a first rib resection is an option for lower thoracic outlet syndrome. Both procedures can also be done simultaneously for best results. Regardless, these are done to give the vasculature and nerves a less narrow port of access to the rest of the upper extremity.[1] Instead of surgical intervention, scalene muscle injections can be used to reduce pain as a more conservative treatment. This injection is more effective in patients that have thoracic outlet syndrome due to whiplash or tractor injuries.[12]",PubMed

Abstract

We are reporting a case of venous thoracic outlet syndrome with recurrent subclavian vein thrombosis in the setting of an ipsilateral brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis that was malfunctioning due to the central vein obstruction. The patient also had a concomitant external jugular vein origin stenosis. Given her body habitus and aversion to recovery after traditional first rib resection, we elected for an alternative treatment with an external jugular vein to internal jugular vein transposition with balloon angioplasty of the stenosed external jugular origin segment. The goal of this was to provide simultaneous relief of her outlet obstruction symptoms and salvage her dialysis access with a less invasive technique.

Abstract

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease which effects cervical posture of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate AS patients according to the degree of cervical disorder and was evaluate them electrophysiologically, functionality, and disease parameters. Our study comprised 64 AS patients and 30 healthy controls. The head posture of patients was evaluated by craniovertebral angle (CVA) measurement. Nerve conduction of bilateral median, radial, ulnar, and medial antebrachial cutaneous (MAC) nerves were studied in all patients. The most important nerve conduction differences in AS patients who have severe forward head posture (FHP) were decrease in sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude and compound muscle action potential amplitudes of median nerves, a decrease in the SNAP amplitude of ulnar nerves, a delay in the F response latency of ulnar nerves, and prolongation in the SNAP latency of the MAC nerve. The FHP disorder that develops in AS patients may have electro physiological effects, similar to those of thoracic outlet syndrome In addition, the functional status of these patients is worsened as severity of FHP increases.",PubMed

Abstract
PURPOSE:

To report results of percutaneous costoclavicular bypass for symptomatic thoracic outlet or cephalic arch occlusion in patients with arteriovenous fistula.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

A retrospective review of percutaneous costoclavicular bypass patients between 2014 and 2018 was performed. Stent grafts were placed subcutaneously over the clavicle from the fistula outflow (axillary or cephalic vein) into a jugular vein or collateral. The procedures were performed in patients who had exhausted or were not candidates for balloon dilation or intravascular stent placement.
RESULTS:

Technical success was 100% (9/9) with resolution of symptoms in all patients. Indications were arm swelling in 67% (6/9), fistula dysfunction in 22% (2/7), and 1 enlarging aneurysm. The fistula outflow was cephalic in 67% (6/9) and axillary in 33% (3/9). The return vessel was external jugular in 78% (7/9) and internal jugular in 22% (2/9). Two overlapping Viabahn stent grafts were used in 88% of cases (7/8) and 3 stent grafts in 1 case. In the initial case, 2 Gore hybrid grafts were used. Stent graft diameter ranged from 9 mm to 13 mm. Mean follow-up was 852 ñ 339 days (range, 488-1483 days). At 12 months and 24 months, primary patency was 67% and 67%, and secondary patency was 89% and 78%, respectively. Complications included late thrombosis and secondary infection. There were no anastomotic leaks or seromas associated with extravascular stent grafts.
CONCLUSIONS:

The percutaneous costoclavicular bypass is a feasible option for thoracic outlet and cephalic arch occlusion in symptomatic dialysis patients.",PubMed
