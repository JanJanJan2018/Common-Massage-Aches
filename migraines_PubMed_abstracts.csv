"BACKGROUND:

The objective of this review was to determine the unmet needs for migraine in East Asian adults and children.
METHODS:

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1, 1988 to January 14, 2019). Studies reporting the prevalence, humanistic and economic burden, and clinical management of migraine in China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and South Korea were included. Studies conducted before 1988 (before the International Headache Society [IHS] first edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders) were not included.
RESULTS:

We retrieved 1337 publications and 41 met the inclusion criteria (28 from China, 7 from Japan, and 6 from South Korea). The 1-year prevalence of migraine (IHS criteria) among adults ranged from 6.0% to 14.3%. Peak prevalence ranged from 11% to 20% for women and 3% to 8% for men (30- to 49-year-olds). For children, prevalence of migraine increased with age. Information on the economic burden and clinical management of migraine was limited, particularly for children. When reported, migraine was significantly associated with high levels of disability and negative effects on quality of life. Studies suggested low levels of disease awareness/diagnosis within each country. Of individuals with migraine from China, 52.9% to 68.6% had consulted a physician previously, 37.2% to 52.7% diagnosed with headache had not been diagnosed with migraine previously, and 13.5% to 18% had been diagnosed with migraine previously. Of individuals with migraine from Japan, 59.4% to 71.8% had never consulted a physician previously, 1.3% to 7.3% regularly consulted physicians for their headache, and only 11.6% of individuals with migraine were aware that they had migraine. In addition, studies suggested that over-the-counter medication use was high and prescription medication use was low in each country.
CONCLUSIONS:

This review suggests that there are unmet needs for migraine in terms of sufficient and appropriate diagnosis, and better management and therapies for treatment of migraine in East Asia. The findings are limited by a lack of recent information and significant gaps in the literature. More recent, population-based studies assessing disease burden and clinical management of migraine are needed to confirm unmet needs for migraine across East Asia.

"Headache disorder is a major public health issue and is a great burden for the person, the health care system, and society. This article reviews epidemiological surveys of primary headache disorders including migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) among adults in the Asia-Pacific region using the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), first or second edition. Chronic daily headache (CDH), which is not an official diagnosis in the ICHD, was also reviewed. In the Asia-Pacific region, the median (range) 1-year prevalence of primary headache disorders was 9.1% (1.5-22.8%) for migraine, 16.2% (10.8-33.8%) for TTH, and 2.9% (1.0-3.9%) for CDH. The 1-year prevalence of migraine and TTH were rather consistent; however, the extremes in the 1-year prevalence of migraine in earlier studies from Hong Kong (1.5%) and South Korea (22.3%) were not repeated in later surveys (Hong Kong: 12.5%; South Korea: 6%). According to the United Nations, the estimated population of the Asia-Pacific region was 3.85 billion in 2010, equaling to headache suffers of 350 million patients with migraine, 624 million with TTH, and 112 million with CDH; many remain to be treated. The prevalence of headache disorders has remained stable over the last 2 decades in this region, where the diversity of geography, race, and development is wide. Thus, the pursuit of better headache care in this region might be our next challenge.

"BACKGROUND:

US Headache Consortium Guidelines state that persons with migraine with headache-related disability should receive certain acute treatments including migraine-specific and other medications. However, many eligible individuals do not receive these therapies. Individuals with migraine may experience barriers to receiving minimal appropriate care. We aimed to identify barriers to care in a population sample of individuals with episodic migraine. We assessed barriers at 3 levels: medical consultation, diagnosis, and acute pharmacologic therapy use and assessed the contribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and headache-specific variables to these barriers.
METHODS:

We identified 3 steps that were minimally necessary to achieve guideline-defined appropriate acute pharmacologic therapy as: (1) consulting a prescribing health care professional; (2) receiving a migraine diagnosis; and (3) using migraine-specific or other appropriate acute treatments. We used data from the 2009 American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study sample to identify persons with episodic migraine with unmet treatment needs, defined by a Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) score corresponding to Grade II (mild), III (moderate), or IV (severe) headache-related disability. We determined whether these individuals had consulted a health care professional for headache over the previous year, if they ever received a medical diagnosis of migraine from a health care professional, and whether they were currently using appropriate acute treatment for migraine (ie, a triptan, prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or an isometheptene-containing agent). We analyzed several socioeconomic, demographic, and headache-specific variables to determine if they were related to barriers in any of the 3 defined steps.
RESULTS:

Of 775 eligible participants with episodic migraine and headache-related disability, 45.5% (n = 353/775) had consulted health care professional for headache in the preceding year. Among those individuals, 86.7% (n = 306/353) reported receiving a medical diagnosis of migraine. Among the diagnosed consulters, 66.7% (204/306) currently used acute migraine-specific treatments. Only 204 (26.3%) individuals successfully completed all 3 steps. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that the strongest predictors of current consulting for headache were having health insurance {odds ratio (OR) = 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.79)}, high headache-related disability (OR = 1.06 [95% CI, 1.0-1.14] for a 10-point change in MIDAS score), and a high composite migraine symptom severity score (OR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.36]). Among consulters, diagnosis was much more likely in women than men (OR = 4.25 [95% CI, 1.61-11.2]) and became increasingly likely with increasing average headache pain severity (OR = 1.44 [95% CI, 1.12-1.87]) and migraine symptom severity score. Among those who were diagnosed, annual household income was the strongest predictor of currently using guideline-defined appropriate acute treatment (OR = 1.44 [95% CI, 1.07-1.93]) followed by a 10-point change in MIDAS score (OR 1.16 [95% CI, 1.02-1.35]).
CONCLUSIONS:

Among persons with migraine in need of medical care (MIDAS Grade II or greater), only one quarter traversed the 3 steps we proposed to be necessary to achieving minimally appropriate care (consulting, diagnosis, and treatment/medication use). Health insurance status was an important predictor of consulting. Among consulters, women were far more likely to be diagnosed than men, suggesting that gender bias in diagnosis may be an important barrier for men. There were economic barriers related to use of appropriate prescription medications. Public health efforts should focus on improving consultation rates, particularly in the uninsured and diagnostic rates particularly in males with migraine.",PubMed
"Earlier studies have raised the issue that Asians have a much lower migraine prevalence than Westerners. This article reviews the recent epidemiologic studies of headache in Asia using International Headache Society (IHS) classification criteria. Except for the Korean study and the first Hong Kong study (1992 to 1993), the prevalence of migraine has been quite consistent, ranging from 8.4% to 12.7%. The sex-specific migraine prevalence was 11.3% to 14.4% in women and 3.6% to 6.7% in men. The prevalence of IHS tension-type headache has also been similar among these studies (15.6% to 25.7%). The consistency of the prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache among these Asian countries is interesting in a region where the cultural background and development are so diverse. These IHS migraine surveys show that migraine is a significant disease in Asia and that its prevalence rate is close to but in the low range of the those reported in Western countries. Two surveys of chronic daily headache conducted in Taiwan, one in the general population and the other in the elderly population, have also revealed prevalence rates (3.2% to 3.9%) similar to those of Western countries (3.0% to 4.7%). The geographic or ethnic diversity of migraine or other types of headache could be downplayed if a similar epidemiologic methodology and an identical case definition were used in the surveys among different regions of the world.",PubMed
"Several studies have shown that the prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) varied between different geographical regions. Therefore, there is a need of a nationwide prevalence study for headache in our country, located between Asia and Europe. This nationwide study was designed to estimate the 1-year prevalence of migraine and TTH and analyse the clinical features, the impact as well as the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the participant households in Turkey. We planned to investigate 6,000 representative households in 21 cities of Turkey; and a total of 5,323 households (response rate of 89%) aged between 18 and 65 years were examined for headache by 33 trained physicians at home on the basis of the diagnostic criteria of the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II). The electronically registered questionnaire was based on the headache features, the associated symptoms, demographic and socio-economic situation and history. Of 5,323 participants (48.8% women; mean age 35.9 ñ 12 years) 44.6% reported recurrent headaches during the last 1 year and 871 were diagnosed with migraine at a prevalence rate of 16.4% (8.5% in men and 24.6% in women), whereas only 270 were diagnosed with TTH at a prevalence rate of 5.1% (5.7% in men and 4.5% in women). The 1-year prevalence of probable migraine was 12.4% and probable TTH was 9.5% additionally. The rate of migraine with aura among migraineurs was 21.5%. The prevalence of migraine was highest among 35-40-year-old women while there were no differences in age groups among men and in TTH overall. More than 2/3 of migraineurs had ever consulted a physician whereas only 1/3 of patients with TTH had ever consulted a physician. For women, the migraine prevalence was higher among the ones with a lower income, while among men, it did not show any change by income. Migraine prevalence was lower in those with a lower educational status compared to those with a high educational status. Chronic daily headache was present in 3.3% and the prevalence of medication overuse headache was 2.1% in our population. There was an important impact of migraine with a monthly frequency of 5.9 ñ 6, and an attack duration of 35.1 ñ 72 h, but only 4.9% were on prophylactic treatment. The one-year prevalence of migraine estimated as 16.4% was similar or even higher than world-wide reported migraine prevalence figures and identical to a previous nation-wide study conducted in 1998, whereas the TTH prevalence was much lower using the same methodology with the ICHD-II criteria.",PubMed
"This study presents the first nationwide survey of migraine in Japan. A representative sample of 4029 subjects aged 15 years or older was selected from the Japanese population according to the quota method. A combination of telephone interview and mailed questionnaire methods was used. Diagnosis of migraine was based on the International Headache Society (IHS) Classification. The overall prevalence of migraine in the past year was 8.4%; 5.8% was migraine without aura and 2.6% was migraine with aura. Significant correlation was found between the prevalence of migraine and such variables as gender, age and district of residence. Doctor attendance rate was very low and 69.4% with migraine had never consulted a physician for headache. Yet, 74.2% complained that migraine headache impaired their daily activity significantly. Only 11.6% were aware that their headache was migraine and 56.9% were using only the over-the-counter drugs. The study revealed a comparably high prevalence of migraine in the general population of Japan compared with other countries. A genetic factor was speculated as the cause of regional difference in migraine prevalence.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVE:

To determine prevalence and burden of headache and migraine in the general population in Germany including patterns of healthcare and medication use.
METHODS:

Telephone interviews were conducted on a representative sample of the general population in Germany aged >or=18 years (n = 7341). Migraine was diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria.
RESULTS:

One-year prevalence was: headache 60.2%, migraine 10.6%, nonmigrainous severe headache 24.7% (women 66.6%, 15.6%, and 27.1%; men 53.0%, 5.3%, and 22.2%). Approximately 60% of headache sufferers reported severe headaches, 30% of which were migrainous. Migraineurs reported more often frequent headaches, disability, use of analgesics, and medical consultation than individuals with nonmigrainous severe headaches. Only 42% of migraineurs had consulted a physician and the majority relied exclusively on over-the-counter medication.
CONCLUSION:

Migraine accounts for a great part of the healthcare impact of headaches in Germany. However, the majority of migraineurs do not seek medical care and may not be optimally treated.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVES:

To summarize the baseline methods for the Migraine in America Symptoms and Treatment (MAST) Study and evaluate gender differences in sociodemographics and headache features; consultation and diagnosis patterns; and patterns of acute and preventive treatment use for migraine among study participants.
BACKGROUND:

The MAST Study is a longitudinal, internet-based panel study of symptoms, approaches to management, and unmet treatment needs among US adults with migraine. This analysis focuses on the initial cross-sectional survey, conducted beginning in 2016, and is intended to update results from earlier national epidemiologic surveys of people with migraine in the United States.
METHODS:

Respondents to the MAST Study were recruited from a US nationwide online research panel. Stratified random sampling identified a representative cohort of adults (aged ò18 years). We administered a validated diagnostic screener based on modified ICHD-3 beta criteria to identify individuals with migraine averaging at least 1 monthly headache day (MHD) over the previous 3 months. A baseline assessment evaluated sociodemographic and headache features, patterns of consultation and diagnosis, and use of acute and preventive medications for migraine. Frequency data and chi-square contrasts (P < .05) were used to compare respondents based on gender.
RESULTS:

Baseline survey data (N = 95,821) identified 18,353 respondents who met criteria for migraine, including 15,133 (women n = 11,049, men n = 4084) reporting at least 1 MHD for the preceding 3 months. The mean age of the sample was 43.1 (13.6) years; 73.0% of respondents were women, and 81.0% were Caucasian. Compared with men, women were younger (46.1 vs 42.0 years; P < .001); had more MHDs (5.6 vs 5.3; P < .001); and were more likely to report moderate or severe headache-related disability (45.9% vs 35.8%; P < .001) and cutaneous allodynia (43.7% vs 29.5%; P < .001). The lifetime rate of medical consultation for headache was 79.8% overall and slightly higher in women than in men. Women were more likely than men to have been diagnosed with migraine (48.3% vs 38.8%, P < .001). While 95.1% of people with migraine currently used acute treatment, the majority (58.9%) used over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to the exclusion of prescription drugs, while 11.3% used exclusively prescription drugs, and 20.5% used both. Among acute prescription medication users, women were more likely than men to take triptans (17.7% vs 14.3%, P < .001), while men were more likely than women to take opioids (14.5% vs 9.2%, P < .001). Oral formulations were used predominately (92.7% of the medication users), but men were more likely to use nasal sprays (13.6% vs 9.4%, P < .001) and injectables (7.9% vs 3.4%, P <  .001). Men (14.5%) were also significantly more likely than women (10.4%) to be taking daily oral preventive medication (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS:

The MAST Study identified a large sample of women and men with migraine from a sampling frame that broadly resembles the US population. Low participation rate increases the risk of response bias, however, comparisons with Census data and prior population studies for the demographic and headache characteristics of the current sample suggest that findings are generalizable to the population of people with migraine. Women had more MHDs than men, and they were more likely to report migraine-related disability and cutaneous allodynia. The lifetime consultation rate for headache was relatively high, but many with migraine symptoms reported never having received a diagnosis of migraine from a healthcare professional. Acute prescription and preventive migraine treatments are underused. Migraine persists as an underdiagnosed and undertreated public health problem in 2018, and there are many opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with this painful, disabling condition.

"This is the first population-based epidemiologic study of chronic headache in South Korea. The diagnosis and classification of headache was according to the criteria of the International Headache Society. Sixty-eight percent of the studied population experienced headache during the preceding year. The estimated prevalences were 22.3% for migraine (male 20.2%, female 24.3%) and 16.2% for tension-type headache (male 17.8%, female 14.7%). In migraine, the 15- to 19-year age group showed maximal prevalence in both sexes (male 28.5%, female 34.7%). The prevalence of tension-type headache was highest in the 50- to 59-year age group in men (24.2%) and in the 20- to 29-year age group in women (20.2%). In migraine, headache intensity was more severe in women than in men, but in tension-type headache there was no difference in the severity of headache between the sexes. Phonophobia was the most common associated symptom of migraine (65.1%). In the migraine with aura group, the most common aura was visual disturbance, including scintillation and image distortion (82.3%). Only 24.4% of migraineurs and 12.3% of patients with tension-type headache had ever consulted a doctor for headache. The prevalence of migraine was not lower than in western countries and much higher than in previous studies conducted in other Asian countries.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Despite the expanding therapeutic armamentarium, many people with episodic migraine (EM) have unmet acute treatment needs.
OBJECTIVE:

To determine the relative frequency of prespecified types of ""unmet treatment needs"" in persons with EM in a US population-based sample.
METHODS:

Eligible participants completed the 2009 American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study survey and met International Classification of Headache Disorders-2nd edition (ICHD-2) criteria for migraine with an average headache day frequency of <15 days per month (EM). We identified 5 domains of unmet treatment needs: (1) dissatisfaction with current acute treatment using 3 summary items from the Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire-revised edition (PPMQ-R); (2) moderate or severe headache-related disability defined by a Migraine Disability Assessment Scale score of ò11; (3) excessive use of opioids or barbiturates defined as use on ò4?days/month or by meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-4th edition criteria for dependence; (4) recurrent use of the emergency department or urgent care clinic for headache defined by ò2 visits in the preceding year for headache; and (5) history of cardiovascular events indicating a possible contraindication to triptan use. For each respondent, we identified their unmet treatment needs in each category and classified them as having no unmet needs or 1 or more unmet needs.
RESULTS:

Of 5591 respondents with EM, 2274 (40.7%) had 1 or more unmet needs; 1467 (26.2%) had exactly 1 unmet need, and 807 (14.4%) had 2 or more unmet needs. Among those with at least 1 unmet need, 1069 (47.0%) had moderate or severe headache-related disability, 851 (37.4%) were dissatisfied with their acute treatment regimen, 728 (32.0%) had excessive opioid or barbiturate use and/or probable dependence, 595 (26.2%) had a history of cardiovascular events, and 129 (5.7%) reported ò2 visits in the preceding year to the emergency department/urgent care clinic for headache. Persons with more headache days, depression, or generalized anxiety were more likely to have unmet treatment needs.
CONCLUSION:

In a population sample of individuals with EM, more than 40% have at least 1 unmet need in the area of acute treatment. The leading reasons for unmet needs, which include headache-related disability and dissatisfaction with current acute treatment, suggest opportunities for improving outcomes for persons with EM.

"BACKGROUND:

Headache disorders are common worldwide, causing pain and disability. India appears to have a very high prevalence of migraine, and of other headache disorders in line with global averages. Our objective was to estimate the burdens attributable to these disorders in order to inform health policy.
METHODS:

In a door-to-door survey, biologically unrelated adults (18-65 years) were randomly sampled from urban and rural areas of Bangalore and interviewed by trained researchers. The validated structured questionnaire enquired into several aspects of burden.
RESULTS:

Of 2,329 participants (non-participation rate 7.4 %), 1,488 (63.9 %; 621 male, 867 female) reported headache in the preceding year. Symptom burden was high. Migraine (1-year prevalence 25.2 %) occurred on average on 28 days/year but, in 38.0 % of cases (ie, 9.6 % of adults), on ò3 days/month (ò10 % of days). All causes of headache on ò15 days/month (prevalence 3.0 %) occurred on a mean of 245 days/year. Both these and migraine were rated severe in intensity. Participants with headache lost 4.3 % of productive time; those with migraine lost 5.8 % (equating to 1.5 % from the adult population). Lost paid worktime accounted for 40 % of this, probably detracting directly from GDP. We estimated population-level disability attributable to migraine using the disability weight from GBD2010 for the ictal state (0.433). Mean disability per person with migraine was 1.8 %, reducing the functional capacity of the entire adult population by 0.46 %. Fewer than one quarter of participants with headache had engaged with health-care services for headache in the last year. Actual expenditure on headache care was greatest among those with headache on ò15 days/month (especially probable medication-overuse headache), but otherwise not high. Expressed willingness to pay for effective treatment for headache was higher, signalling dissatisfaction with current treatments.
CONCLUSIONS:

In Karnataka State, southern India, prevalent headache disorders, especially migraine, give rise to commensurately heavy burdens. Limited access to health care fails to alleviate these. Structured headache services, with their basis in primary care, are the most efficient, effective, affordable and equitable solution. They could be implemented within the health-care infrastructure of India and are likely to be cost-saving. This solution requires political will, itself dependent on awareness.

"BACKGROUND:

Headache associated with menses is often not formally diagnosed.
OBJECTIVES:

The goal of this study was to evaluate patients with menstrual headache who had never previously been diagnosed with migraine and assign 1988 International Headache Society (IHS) diagnoses to their menstrual headaches. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the treatment efficacy of newly diagnosed menstrually related migraine (MRM) with sumatriptan 100 mg and patient satisfaction with sumatriptan versus satisfaction with previous therapy.
METHODS:

Patients were recruited via advertisement in a local daily newspaper, and headache diagnosis and eligibility criteria of respondents were assessed by telephone. During telephone screening, IHS criteria for headache were applied to symptoms described by patients as menstrual headache. Those with previously undiagnosed headaches who fulfilled criteria for migraine without or with aura (IHS 1.1 or 1.2) and all inclusion/exclusion criteria at visit 1 were provided with sumatriptan 100 mg to treat 1 MRM. Patients were instructed to treat their next MRM as early as possible after the onset of headache. A treatment diary was provided with study medication for documentation of headache pain severity and associated symptoms; time of treatment and response at 30, 60, and 90 minutes and at 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours posttreatment; medication for persistence or recurrence; adverse effects; and onset of menstrual cycle. In analysis, headache response was defined as a reduction in pretreatment head pain from moderate or severe to mild or no pain.
RESULTS:

A total of 153 patients responded to an advertisement seeking menstrual headache sufferers. After the preliminary screening by telephone, 105 patients were assigned IHS diagnoses based on reported symptoms associated with their menstrual headache. Overall, 63% (66/105) fulfilled criteria for IHS 1.1 (migraine without aura), 12% (13/105) met criteria for IHS 1.2 (migraine with aura), and 5% (5/105) met criteria for IHS 1.7 (migrainous disorder). Of the 79 patients meeting the criteria for IHS 1.1 or 1.2, 45 patients were enrolled. Thirty-nine (mean age, 34.8 years; mean duration of experiencing menstrual headaches, 11.1 years) of the 45 patients treated 1 MRM with sumatriptan 100 mg per protocol (6 patients were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent). Headache response was reported by 70% of patients at 2 hours and 86% at 4 hours. The pain-flee response after treatment at the moderate or severe phase occurred in 41% of patients at 2 hours and in 61% at 4 hours. All 39 patients reported previous use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for acute treatment of headache; in addition, 1 of the 39 also took acetylsalicylic acid/caffeine/butalbital, 1 took acetaminophen/caffeine/butalbital, 1 took ketorolac, and 1 took acetaminophen plus codeine. In terms of patient satisfaction, 69% of patients were satisfied with sumatriptan versus 15% of patients who were satisfied with their previous therapy.
CONCLUSIONS:

Seventy-five percent of women with previously undiagnosed menstrual headaches met diagnostic criteria for migraine in this small sample. Two hours after treatment with sumatriptan 100 rag, 70% of patients with headaches treated at moderate to severe pain had a pain relief response (reduction to mild or no pain).",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Migraine is a common neurological problem associated with the highest burden amongst neurological conditions in terms of years lived with disability. Medications can be used as prophylaxis or rescue medicines, but are costly and not always effective. A range of psychological interventions have been developed to manage migraine.
OBJECTIVES:

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine in adults.
SEARCH METHODS:

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from their inception until July 2018, and trials registries in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand for randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention for adults with migraine.
SELECTION CRITERIA:

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a psychological therapy for people with chronic or episodic migraine, with or without aura. Interventions could be compared to another active treatment (psychological or medical), an attention-placebo (e.g. supportive counselling) or other placebo, routine care, or waiting-list control. We excluded studies where fewer than 15 participants completed each arm.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:

We extracted study characteristics and outcome data at post-treatment and the longest available follow-up. We analysed intervention versus control comparisons for the primary outcome of migraine frequency. We measured migraine frequency using days with migraines or number of migraine attacks measured in the four weeks after treatment. In addition, we analysed the following secondary outcomes: responder rate (the proportion of participants with a 50% reduction in migraine frequency between the four weeks prior to and the four weeks after treatment); migraine intensity; migraine duration; migraine medication usage; mood; quality of life; migraine-related disability; and proportion of participants reporting adverse events during the treatment. We included these variables, where available, at follow-up, the timing of which varied between the studies. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence.
MAIN RESULTS:

We found 21 RCTs including 2482 participants with migraine, and we extracted meta-analytic data from 14 of these studies. The majority of studies recruited participants through advertisements, included participants with migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and those with and without aura. Most intervention arms were a form of behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy. The majority of comparator arms were no treatment, routine care or waiting list. Interventions varied from one 20-minute session to 14 hours of intervention. No study had unequivocally low risk of bias; all had at least one domain at high risk of bias, and 20 had two to five domains at high risk. Reporting of randomisation procedures and allocation concealment were at high or unclear risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of evidence for outcomes to very low, due to very serious limitations in study quality and imprecision. Reporting in trials was poor; we found no preregistrations stipulating the outcomes, or demonstrating equivalent expectations between groups. Few studies reported our outcomes of interest, most only reported outcomes post treatment; follow-up data were sparse.Post-treatment effectsWe found no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions for migraine frequency in number of migraines or days with migraine (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.13; 4 studies, 681 participants; very low-quality evidence).The responder rate (proportion of participants with migraine frequency reduction of more than 50%) was greater for those who received a psychological intervention compared to control: 101/186 participants (54%) with psychological therapy; 37/152 participants (24%) with control (risk ratio (RR) 2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.98; 4 studies, 338 participants; very low-quality evidence). We found no effect of psychological therapies on migraine intensity (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.02; 4 studies, 685 participants). There were no data for migraine duration (hours of migraine per day). There was no effect on migraine medication usage (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.24; 2 studies, 483 participants), mood (mean difference (MD) 0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.49; 4 studies, 432 participants), quality of life (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; 4 studies, 565 participants), or migraine-related disability (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.00; 6 studies, 952 participants). The proportion of participants reporting adverse events did not differ between those receiving psychological treatment (9/107; 8%) and control (30/101; 30%) (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 7.85; 2 studies, 208 participants). Only two studies reported adverse events and so we were unable to draw any conclusions.We rated evidence from all studies as very low quality.Follow-upOnly four studies reported any follow-up data. Follow-ups ranged from four months following intervention to 11 months following intervention. There was no evidence of an effect on any outcomes at follow-up (very low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:

This review identified 21 studies of psychological interventions for the management of migraine. We did not find evidence that psychological interventions affected migraine frequency, a result based on four studies of primarily brief treatments. Those who received psychological interventions were twice as likely to be classified as responders in the short term, but this was based on very low-quality evidence and there was no evidence of an effect of psychological intervention compared to control at follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on medication usage, mood, migraine-related disability or quality of life. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on migraine frequency in the short-term or long-term. In terms of adverse events, we were unable to draw conclusions as there was insufficient evidence. High and unclear risk of bias in study design and reporting, small numbers of participants, performance and detection bias meant that we rated all evidence as very low quality. Therefore, we conclude that there is an absence of high-quality evidence to determine whether psychological interventions are effective in managing migraine in adults and we are uncertain whether there is any difference between psychological therapies and controls.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Though triptans are the most widely used acute treatments for migraine, response to treatment is sometimes suboptimal. Triptan therapy is often augmented by the addition of other acute treatments. The benefits of this practice have not been examined in large-scale, real-world observational studies.
OBJECTIVES:

To assess changes in headache-related disability associated with adding additional acute treatments to a triptan regimen by category of added treatment including: a second triptan, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids or barbiturates.
METHODS:

Subjects were participants in the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study, a longitudinal, US population-based study of individuals with ""severe"" headache. Respondents who met International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 beta criteria for migraine were on triptan therapy per respondent self-report, used the same triptan, and provided headache-related disability data for at least 2 consecutive years. Subjects were divided based on headache days per month into 3 groups: low-frequency episodic migraine (LFEM, 0-4), moderate-frequency episodic migraine (MFEM, 5-9), and high-frequency episodic migraine/chronic migraine (HFEM/CM,?ò?10 headache days per month). HFEM and CM were combined into a single group for analyses because of sample size limitations. Patterns of acute treatment for migraine were monitored from one year to the next over the following couplets of years (2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008, and 2008-2009). The first eligible couplet was analyzed for each respondent. Medication regimens studied included: (1) maintaining current triptan use (consistent group); (2) adding a different triptan; (3) adding an NSAID; or (4) adding a combination analgesic containing opioids or barbiturates. We assessed change in Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score from the first to the second year of a couplet, contrasting scores of participants with consistent use with those who added an acute treatment to their triptan regimen.
RESULTS:

The study sample (N?=?2128) included 111 individuals who added another triptan, 118 who added an opioid or barbiturate, and 69 who added an NSAID, with referent groups of approximately 600 cases in each group who remained consistent. In general, MIDAS scores were higher among those who made changes from one year to the next compared with those who did not make changes in therapy. In fully adjusted models, adding triptans or NSAIDs was associated with increased disability for HFEM/CM cases at follow-up but decreased disability at follow-up for MFEM cases, resulting in significant interaction effects for both adding triptans and NSAIDs, respectively (15.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75, 31.01, 38.52, 95% CI 12.43, 64.61).
CONCLUSIONS:

While the effects of adding vs staying consistent on the outcome of headache-related disability varied by medication type added and headache frequency strata, in general, these results suggest that for individuals with migraine, adding acute therapies to current triptan use is generally not associated with reductions in headache-related disability. The results were strongest among persons with HFEM and CM. These results identify important unmet medical needs in current migraine management, especially among patients with high-frequency migraine, and suggest that alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve patient outcomes.",PubMed
"CONTEXT:

Headache experts have suggested that to improve the recognition of migraine, patients with a stable pattern of episodic, disabling headache and a normal physical exam should be considered to have migraine in the absence of contradictory evidence. The premise upon which this approach is based-that is, that episodic, recurrent primary headache in the clinic is usually migraine-has not been evaluated in prospective clinical studies.
OBJECTIVES:

To (1) evaluate the diagnoses of patients consulting their physician with primary episodic headache and (2) compare clinic diagnoses and patient self-diagnoses with International Headache Society (IHS) headache diagnoses assigned on the basis of longitudinal data from patient diaries.
DESIGN:

Prospective, open-label study. During the screening visit, patients self-reported a headache diagnosis and then were assigned a headache diagnosis by their physician following his or her customary practice. Patients with a new physician diagnosis of migraine or nonmigraine primary headache were given diaries to record headache symptoms for up to 3 months or 6 attacks. Members of an expert panel, unaware of the clinic diagnosis, used diary data to assign a headache diagnosis to each attack and to each patient.
SETTING:

One hundred twenty-eight (128) practices in 15 countries including the United States.
PATIENTS:

A total of 1203 male and female patients between 18 and 65 years of age who consulted their physician with headache as a primary or secondary complaint.
RESULTS:

Overall, 94% of patients with a physician diagnosis of nonmigraine primary headache or a new clinic diagnosis of migraine had IHS-defined migraine (76%) or probable migraine (migrainous) (18%) headache on the basis of longitudinal diary data. A new clinic diagnosis of migraine was almost always correct: 98% of patients with a clinic diagnosis of migraine had IHS-defined migraine (87% of patients) or probable migraine (11% of patients) headache on the basis of longitudinal diary data. On the other hand, review of diaries of patients with a clinic diagnosis of nonmigraine revealed that 82% of these patients had IHS-defined migraine (48%) or probable migraine (34%) headache. Altogether, one in four patients (25%) with IHS-defined migraine according to longitudinal diary data did not receive a clinic diagnosis of migraine.
CONCLUSIONS:

These findings support the diagnostic approach of considering episodic, disabling primary headaches with an otherwise normal physical exam to be migraine in the absence of contradictory evidence. If in doubt of diagnosis or when assigning a nonmigraine diagnosis, strong consideration should be given to the use of a diary to confirm primary headache diagnosis.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

During the past decade, the introduction of the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) and the initiation of active campaigns to increase awareness of the high magnitude, burden, and impact of migraine have stimulated numerous studies of population-based data on the prevalence, correlates, and impact of migraine.
OBJECTIVE:

This paper provides an update of the literature on the worldwide epidemiology of migraine from studies that included the ICHD-II criteria. The aims of this paper are: (1) to review evidence regarding the magnitude of migraine; (2) to summarize information on the correlates and impact of migraine; and (3) to discuss the contributions, challenges, and future directions in the epidemiology of migraine. Evidence on the magnitude of migraine is divided into the following types of data: (1) prevalence rates of ICHD-II-defined migraine and tension-type headache from international population-based studies of adults; (2) the magnitude of migraine in U.S. studies; (3) ICHD-II-based international prevalence rates of ICHD-II-defined migraine in children; and (4) incidence rates of migraine from prospective longitudinal studies.
METHODS:

A comprehensive review of the literature on the prevalence of migraine subtypes and tension-type headache defined by ICHD-II criteria during the past decade was conducted and aggregate weighted rates across studies were derived.
RESULTS:

Across the 19 studies of adults that employed the ICHD-II criteria, the aggregate weighted estimates of the 12-month prevalence of definite migraine are 11.5%, and probable migraine of 7%, yielding a total of 18.5%. The cross-study weighted aggregate rate of migraine with aura is 4.4%, chronic migraine is 0.5%, and of tension-type headache is 13%. There has been even greater growth in international prevalence data on migraine in children, with a total of 21 studies of children that have employed the ICDH-II criteria. The aggregate weighted rate of definite migraine in children is 10.1% and migraine with aura is 1.6%. The well-established demographic correlates of migraine including the equal sex ratio in childhood, with increasing prevalence of migraine in females across adolescence to mid-adulthood were confirmed in these studies. Despite increasing effort to increase awareness of migraine, approximately 50% of those with frequent and/or severe migraine do not receive professional treatment.
CONCLUSIONS:

This review demonstrates that the descriptive epidemiology of migraine has reached its maturity. The prevalence rates and sociodemographic correlates have been stable across 50 years. These developments justify a shift in efforts to the application of the designs and methods of analytic epidemiology. Retrospective case-control studies followed by prospective cohort studies that test specific associations are likely to enhance our understanding of the predictors of incidence and progression of migraine, subtypes of migraine with differential patterns of onset and course, and specific environmental exposures that may have either causal or provocative influences on migraine etiology.",PubMed
"e conducted the first population-based migraine survey in Taipei, Taiwan, using a validated questionnaire administered by interviewers during the period from August 1997 to June 1998. Our target population comprised all individuals (age > or = 15 years) in 1400 randomly selected households. Migraine diagnoses were made according to the classification criteria of migraine without aura proposed by the International Headache Society, 1988, except that attacks with a duration of between 2 h and 4 h were also included. Of the 4434 eligible subjects in the 1211 respondent households, 3377 (76%) completed the questionnaire. After adjustment for age and sex distribution according to the population structure, the prevalence of migraine was 9.1% (F/M 14.4%/4.5%). Fifty-four percent of the subjects with migraine had consulted a physician about their headaches in the past year. However, only 18% of them reported that their migraine had been diagnosed by physicians. This study found that Taipei residents have the highest migraine prevalence of all Chinese populations studied, although it is still in the low range of prevalence compared with the results from Western countries.",PubMed
"This overview of the published epidemiological evidence of migraine helps to identify the size of the public-health problem that migraine represents. It also highlights the need for further epidemiological studies in many parts of the world to gain full understanding of the scale of clinical, economic and humanistic burdens attributable to it. This paper presents some of the work on migraine undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Global Burden of Disease study conducted in 2000 and reported in the World Health Report 2001. Migraine was not included in the first Global Burden of Disease 1990. The paper also discussed the measurement of disability attributable to headache disorders using WHO ICF Classification. Using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a summary measure of population health (which adds disability to mortality), WHO have shown that mental and neurological disorders collectively account for 30.8% of all years of healthy life lost to disability (YLDs) whilst migraine, one amongst these, alone accounts for 1.4% and is in the top 20 causes of disability worldwide. This information is combined with the increasingly widely accepted belief that disability and functioning are relevant parameters for monitoring the health of nations and that there is an increasing need to measure them. WHO's Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a model of human functioning and disability, as well as a classification system, that allows us to highlight and measure all dimensions of disability. ICF applied to headache disorders allows comparability with other health conditions as well as evaluation of the role of the environment as a cause of disability amongst people with headache. Migraine causes a large proportion of the non-fatal disease-related burden worldwide. Our knowledge of headache related burden is incomplete and it is necessary to add to it epidemiological studies in many parts of the world and to combine this with measurements of disability using both DALYs and WHO's ICF Classification. The work described here has been the base for the Global Campaign against Headache disorders: ""Lifting the Burden"", launched in 2004 jointly by WHO, IHS (International Headache Society), WHA (World Headache Alliance) and EHF (European Headache Federation).",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

The prevalence of migraine headache varies somewhat across geographic regions. The last Canadian population-based study of migraine was in 1994. We report the findings of the Canadian Women and Migraine Survey. In addition to reporting migraine prevalence in Canadian women, the survey identified current consultation and treatment practices of women with migraine, and the psychological burden of migraine.
METHODS:

The survey was conducted with a population-based sample of 1210 women using standard telephone research methods. Headache diagnoses were based on the International Headache Society (IHS) Classification.
RESULTS:

Calculated prevalence of migraine headache was 26%. Only 51% of women with migraine had consulted a physician about their headaches. Women with migraines rely on over-the-counter medications and non-specific prescription medications. Less than 10% of women with migraine use triptans/dihydroergotamine for primary treatment. Ninety seven percent of women with migraine reported at least one psychosocial impact resulting from migraines.
CONCLUSIONS:

The prevalence of migraine in Canadian women appears static, and is again shown to be slightly higher than that reported in the United States. As in other epidemiologic studies, many women with migraine do not seek medical help for their headaches and perhaps as a result, few are using migraine-specific medications to treat their headaches. The impact of migraine on Canadian women is substantial with almost all women with migraine reporting adverse psychosocial effects of migraines on their lives.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVE:

To assess the rates and predictors of traversing steps essential to good medical care for chronic migraine, including: (1) medical consultation, (2) accurate diagnosis, and (3) minimal pharmacologic treatment. Candidate predictors included socioeconomic, demographic, and headache-specific variables.
BACKGROUND:

Previous research has established that barriers to effective management for episodic migraine include the absence of health insurance, lack of appropriate medical consultation, failure to receive an accurate diagnosis, and not being offered a regimen with acute and preventive treatments.
METHODS/DESIGN:

The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study, a longitudinal web-based panel study of migraine, included a cross-sectional module focused on patterns of and barriers to medical care. Participants eligible for this analysis met the study criteria for chronic migraine, had evidence of headache-related disability, and provided data on health insurance status. The main outcomes in the current analysis included the proportion of respondents who sought consultation for headache with a designated healthcare professional, self-reported receiving a diagnosis of chronic or transformed migraine, and received minimal pharmacologic treatment for headache with a focus on prescribed acute and preventive treatments.
RESULTS:

In the CaMEO Study, 80,783 respondents provided study data, 16,789 (20.8% of respondents) met criteria for migraine, and 1476 (8.8% of those with migraine) met chronic migraine criteria. In total, 1254 participants (85.0% of those with chronic migraine) met inclusion criteria for this analysis. Of those, 512 respondents (40.8%) reported currently consulting with a healthcare professional for headache. Odds of consulting increased with increasing age (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.03), migraine-related disability (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.04), and migraine severity (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.11-1.22) and presence of health insurance (OR 4.61; 95% CI 3.05-6.96). Among those consulting a healthcare professional, 126 (24.6%) received an accurate diagnosis and 56 of those with a correct diagnosis (44.4%) received both acute and preventive pharmacologic treatments; odds of a CM diagnosis were higher for women (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.03-3.61), those with greater migraine severity (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14-1.37), and those currently consulting a specialist (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.54-3.69). No predictors of receiving appropriate treatment were identified among those currently consulting. Among our sample of people with chronic migraine, only 56 (4.5%) individuals successfully traversed the series of 3 barriers to successful chronic migraine care (ie, consulted a healthcare professional for migraine, received an accurate diagnosis, and were prescribed minimal acute and preventive pharmacologic treatments).
CONCLUSION:

Our findings suggest that <5% of persons with chronic migraine traversed 3 barriers to receiving care for headache (consultation, diagnosis, and treatment), representing a large unmet need for improving care in this population. Predictors of consulting a healthcare professional included age, having health insurance, greater migraine-related disability, and greater migraine symptom severity. Among those consulting, predictors of an appropriate diagnosis included consulting a specialist, female sex, and greater migraine severity. Public health efforts are needed to improve outcomes for patients with chronic migraine by a range of interventions and educational efforts aimed at improving consultation rates, diagnostic accuracy, and adherence to minimal pharmacologic treatment.
