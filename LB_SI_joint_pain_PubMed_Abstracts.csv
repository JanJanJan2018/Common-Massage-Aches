"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of joint pain and disability, and chondrocyte senescence is a key pathological process in OA and may be a target of new therapeutics. MicroRNA-140 (miR-140) plays a protective role in OA, but little is known about its epigenetic effect on chondrocyte senescence. In this study, we first validated the features of chondrocyte senescence characterized by increased cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and the expression of senescence-associated ?-galactosidase (SA-?Gal), p16INK4a, p21, p53, and ?H2AX in human knee OA. Then, we revealed in interleukin 1? (IL-1?)-induced OA chondrocytes in vitro that pretransfection with miR-140 effectively inhibited the expression of SA-?Gal, p16INK4a, p21, p53, and ?H2AX. Furthermore, in vivo results from trauma-induced early-stage OA rats showed that intra-articularly injected miR-140 could rapidly reach the chondrocyte cytoplasm and induce molecular changes similar to the in vitro results, resulting in a noticeable alleviation of OA progression. Finally, bioinformatics analysis predicted the potential targets of miR-140 and a mechanistic network by which miR-140 regulates chondrocyte senescence. Collectively, miR-140 can effectively attenuate the progression of early-stage OA by retarding chondrocyte senescence, contributing new evidence of the involvement of miR-mediated epigenetic regulation of chondrocyte senescence in OA pathogenesis.",PubMed
"INTRODUCTION:

Multidisciplinary approach to osteoarthritis (OA) in older patients, whose functional decline is multifactorial and who present with multiple symptoms, has been long advocated, but it is still seldom implemented in daily practice. Therefore, further indications for the management of OA are eagerly awaited and should consider the specific clinical features of this population, including the presence of frailty and comorbidities. This clinical approach should be based both on well-grounded evidence and practical experience of experts in OA management. This manuscript comments the multidisciplinary integrated approach for OA management in the older population, according to the opinion of a multidisciplinary Panel of Experts.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:

This project was developed by a Steering Committee, which consisted of three experts that were identified by the Italian Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (Societ… Italiana di Medicina Fisica e Riabilitativa, SIMFER) and the Italian Society for Unified and Interdisciplinary Management of Musculoskeletal Pain and Algodystrophy (Societ… Italiana per la Gestione Unificata e Interdisciplinare del Dolore muscolo-scheletrico e dell'Algodistrofia, SI-GUIDA). The Steering Committee identified key evidence on the management of OA in the older through systematic research in MEDLINE and EMBASE, selected the most relevant paper among those identified, and defined some questions concerning current unmet needs in the management of symptomatic OA in the older accordingly. The Panel discussed the identified evidence and questions during two meetings.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:

The discussion was used to generate seven statements with relevance to clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS:

Older adults with symptomatic OA present multiple concomitant issues, including other diseases, marked pain, poly-pharmacy, and often poor psychological and/or socio-economical status. According to the above-described evidence, it is crucial that the approach to those patients is multidisciplinary and based on the use of dedicated tools. A combination of exercise, mechanical support and properly selected analgesic treatment will greatly help the management of the OA patient, improving at the same time his/her quality of life.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Minimally invasive fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint has gained popularity for the treatment of refractory dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of minimally invasive SI joint fusion between cylindrical threaded implants (CTIs) and triangular dowel implants (TDIs).
METHODS:

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent SI joint fusions with either CTIs or TDIs. Data collected included patient demographics, perioperative data, and all patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index, and Short Form-12 at 6 months and 1 year. The change from baseline PROs between the cohorts was analyzed as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included revision rates and time to revision between the two cohorts. A P value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS:

One hundred fifty-six consecutive patients underwent SI joint fusion, 74 patients with CTIs and 82 with TDIs. There was a significant difference in procedure length with CTI averaging 60.0 minutes (confidence interval: 55.7-64.3) and TDI averaging 41.2 minutes (confidence interval: 38.4-43.9, P < 0.0005). In both cohorts, there was a significant improvement in all PROs at 6 months when compared with preoperative values. However, when compared, there was no significant difference between the cohorts at 6-month follow-up or 1-year follow-up for either VAS-back, VAS-leg, Oswestry Disability Index, or Short Form-12. A 6.1% revision rate in the CTI cohort was observed compared with a 2.4% revision rate in the TDI cohort (P = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS:

SI joint fusions with TDI or CTI offer a significant improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life. However, no difference was observed between devices to suggest superior clinical outcomes. Increased revision rates in the Rialto group warrants further investigation.",PubMed
"Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis which initially presents as a monoarthritis that usually favours peripheral joints namely the 1st MTP. It was reported in the literature to rarely involve the axial joint, such as the sacroiliac joint, and often mimics seronegative spondyloarthritis (SpA). Gout is a male disease and after menopause the risk in females is equal to males. Previous reports describe male patients developing gout involving the SI joint. We report a lady with a history of gout presenting with acute onset lower back pain. MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed unilateral sacroilitis. With the help of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) which is a newer imaging technique, a diagnosis of gout involving the sacroiliac joint was established. Gout involving the sacroiliac joints is rare, however it should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with unilateral sacroilitis given the similarity in presentation to SpA. Utilization of newer imaging modalities including DECT can highly guide in establishing a diagnosis and providing the correct treatment.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVE:

This study compares participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (the Minimal Invasive Treatment [MinT] trials) to participants in a related observational study with regard to their low back pain (LBP) symptom course.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:

Eligible patients were diagnosed with chronic LBP originating from the facet joints (N = 615) or sacroiliac (SI) joints (N = 533) and were treated with radiofrequency denervation and an exercise program. Randomized patients were compared to patients in the related observational study who fulfilled all RCT eligibility criteria (observational group 1) and to patients who did not fulfill at least one of the RCT eligibility criteria (observational group 2). Outcomes were pain intensity, treatment success, and functional status over a 3-month period. Longitudinal mixed-model analyses and linear regression models were applied to analyze the differences in outcomes between the RCT and observational study groups.
RESULTS:

No differences in symptom course were found between patients in the RCTs and patients in observational group 1. Patients with facet joint pain in observational group 2 had overall less treatment success (odds ratios [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.90), and less improvement in physical functioning (mean difference [MD], 5.82; 95% CI, 2.54-9.11) compared to the RCT patients. Patients with SI joint pain in observational group 2 had higher pain scores (MD, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.72), less treatment success (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96), and less improvement in physical functioning (MD, 7.16; 95% CI, 3.84-10.47) compared to the RCT patients.
CONCLUSION:

This supports the generalizability of results from the MinT RCTs as this study suggests that these RCTs reflect clinical practice when comparing similar populations. To what extent this holds true for all RCTs in LBP should be further explored.",PubMed
"With regard to the association of sacroiliac (SI) pain and hip arthroscopy outcomes, it is vital to understand that imaging the SI joint may be unreliable. A recent systematic review on diagnostic accuracy for SI joint pain concluded that more reliable criteria are strongly positive responses to diagnostic injection and a physical examination in which 3 or more provocative maneuvers are positive. SI joint degenerative changes can be found in a majority of asymptotic patients and might be considered normal finding until proven otherwise. When it comes to the spine and pelvis, radiologic changes should be interpreted by caution by both hip surgeons and spine surgeons.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVES:

Patients with low back pain (LBP) are often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are modestly effective for LBP, but many patients with LBP continue to suffer despite treatment with these medications. We compared pain and functional outcomes one week after ED discharge among patients randomized to a one-week course of ibuprofen + acetaminophen versus ibuprofen + placebo.
METHODS:

This was a randomized, double-blind study conducted in two urban EDs. Patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular LBP of no more than 2 weeks duration were eligible for enrollment immediately prior to discharge from an ED if they had a score > 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), a 24-item validated instrument, indicating more than minimal functional impairment. All patients were given a standardized ten-minute LBP educational session prior to discharge. The primary outcome was improvement on the RMDQ between ED discharge and one week later. One secondary outcome was pain intensity, as measured on a 4-point descriptive scale (severe, moderate, mild, none) at one week.
RESULTS:

Enrollment began in October 2018. 120 patients met selection criteria and were randomized. Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between the two groups. By one week after the ED visit, patients randomized to ibuprofen + placebo reported a mean improvement in the RMDQ 9.7 of 11.9 (SD), while those randomized to ibuprofen + acetaminophen reported a mean improvement of 11.1 (SD 10.7). The 95%CI for the between-group difference of 0.8 was -3.0, 4.7. At one week, moderate or severe pain was reported by 15/53 (28%) patients in the ibuprofen + placebo group and 16/57 (28%) patients in the ibuprofen + acetaminophen group (95%CI for between group difference of 0%: -17, 17%).
CONCLUSION:

Among ED patients with acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular LBP, adding acetaminophen to ibuprofen does not improve outcomes within one week.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

The sacroiliac joint is a common cause of low back pain. Due to variable symptoms, the diagnosis is often very difficult. For diagnosis, systemic disease, as well as pathologies in the hips and lumbar spine must be excluded.
OBJECTIVES:

To describe anatomy and function of the joint and underlying pathologies. To present the evidence of actual diagnostic and therapeutic options.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

An extensive literature research was carried out on PubMed.
RESULTS:

The sacroiliac joint is an important and biomechanically complex joint. There are many controversial diagnostic tests to identify the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain. The cause of the dysfunction must be identified in order to treat it correctly and to prevent a chronification of the pain. The gold standard is conservative care.
CONCLUSION:

The sacroiliac joint must be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with low back pain. Diagnostic tests are often insufficient for the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain. Many of the current diagnostic and therapeutic options present weak evidence.

"OBJECTIVES:

To assess the effectiveness and cost-utility of a multifaceted eHealth strategy compared to usual care in improving patients' back pain beliefs, and in decreasing disability and absenteeism.
DESIGN:

Stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial with parallel economic evaluation.
SETTING:

Dutch primary healthcare.
PARTICIPANTS:

Patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain by their general practitioner or physiotherapist. Patients with serious comorbidities or confirmed pregnancy were excluded. 779 patients were randomised into intervention group (n=331, 59% female; 60.4% completed study) or control group (n=448, 57% female; 77.5% completed study).
INTERVENTIONS:

The intervention consisted of a multifaceted eHealth strategy that included a (mobile) website, digital monthly newsletters, and social media platforms. The website provided information about back pain, practical advice (eg, on self-management), working and returning to work with back pain, exercise tips, and short video messages from healthcare providers and patients providing information and tips. The control consisted of a digital patient information letter. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:

The primary outcome was back pain beliefs. Secondary outcome measures were disability and absenteeism, and for the preplanned economic evaluation quality of life and societal costs were measured.
RESULTS:

There were no between-group differences in back pain beliefs, disability, or absenteeism. Mean intervention costs were ?70- and the societal cost difference was ?535-in favour of the intervention group, but no significant cost savings were found. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that the intervention dominated usual care and the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.85 on a willingness-to-pay of ?10.000/quality adjusted life year (QALY).
CONCLUSIONS:

A multifaceted eHealth strategy was not effective in improving patients' back pain beliefs or in decreasing disability and absenteeism, but showed promising cost-utility results based on QALYs.

"STUDY DESIGN:

Randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE:

The determine the short-term effectiveness of thoracic manipulation (MAN) when compared to sham manipulation (SHAM) for individuals with LBP.
BACKGROUND:

Low back pain is one of the most prevalent and disabling musculoskeletal conditions. The management of LBP has been studied extensively, yet the most effective treatment strategies remain to be elucidated.
METHODS:

Patients with LBP were stratified based on symptom duration and randomly assigned to MAN or SHAM treatment groups. Groups received three visits which included core stabilization exercises and patient education. Factorial repeated measures ANOVA and multiple regression was performed for pain, disability, and fear-avoidance. Mann Whitney-U test was used to analyze patient perceived improvement with the Global Rating of Change scale (GROC) at follow up.
RESULTS:

Ninety participants completed the study (mean age 38 ñ 11.5 years; 70% female, 72% chronic LBP). The overall group-by-time interaction for the ANOVA was not significant for MODQ, NPRS, FABQ. GROC was not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSION:

Three sessions of thoracic manipulation, education, and exercise did not result in improved outcomes when compared to a sham manipulation, education, and exercise in individuals with chronic LBP. Future studies are needed to identify the most effective management strategies for the treatment of low back pain. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02853357).

"Back pain and its associated complications are of increasing importance among military members. The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a common source of chronic low back pain (LBP) and functional disability. Many patients suffering from chronic LBP utilize opioids to help control their symptoms. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used extensively to treat pain emanating from many different musculoskeletal origins; however, its use in the SIJ has been studied only on a limited basis. The patient in this case report presented with chronic LBP localized to the SIJ and subsequent functional disability managed with high-dose opioids. After failure of traditional treatments, she was given an ultrasound-guided PRP injection of the SIJ which drastically decreased her pain and disability and eventually allowed for complete opioid cessation. Her symptom relief continued 1 year after the injection. This case demonstrates the potential of ultrasound-guided PRP injections as a long-term treatment for chronic LBP caused by SIJ dysfunction in military service members, which can also aid in the weaning of chronic opioid use.",PubMed
"Background:

Low back pain is a burden worldwide and biological, psychological, and social mechanisms play a role in its development and persistence. Current guidelines support care using the biopsychosocial model. However, biomedical constructs dominate clinician training, and it is unknown the extent to which health science students understand the psychosocial determinates of a patient's low back pain. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to report health science students' current knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain.
Methods:

A scoping review framework was used to search electronic databases for research examining health science students' knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. The nature and findings of the studies are highlighted using the data charting tool. Each study was analyzed to determine the type of outcome measurement used. Scores were compared to minimum accepted scores, between disciplines, as education advanced, and after educational modules.
Results:

Fourteen studies published between 2004 and 2019 were identified. Seven healthcare disciplines were represented.In total, 12 different measurement tools were utilized. In 9 studies students demonstrated inadequate knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. Three tools compared disciplines and nationalities. Three tools were associated with practice behavior. Eight studies showed improvement as students' education advanced, and 3 studies demonstrated improvements in knowledge after implementation of pain education modules of varied lengths. Of those, two showed significant improvement.
Conclusions:

Health science students in these studies had substandard understanding of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. Dedicated pain education has the potential to improve low back pain understanding, resulting in more guideline appropriate care recommendation.

"We have received and gladly read the letter entitled ?Non-Specific Low Back Pain In Elderly And The Effects Of Myofascial Release Technique Combined With Core Stabilization Exercise: Not Just Muscles [Letter]? related to our recently published study. First of all, we would like to express our deep-seated thanks to Professor Bordoni for his contributions. We believe that the ideas expressed in correspondence with the editor will help to take a deeper look into the literature and we are pleased to participate in this dialogue.

The aim of our study entitled as ?The Effects Of Myofascial Release Technique Combined With Core Stabilization Exercise In Elderly With Non-Specific Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled, Single-Blind Study? was to present a different perspective to the approaches used in the treatment of low-back pain in elderly individuals with taking the role of fascia into consideration. Although non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP) is a complex condition, in a study conducted in elderly individuals with chronic low-back pain ?myofascial pain? was found to be in the first place with the rate of 95.5% as the most common symptom.1 In spite of this high rate, myofascial structure has not been adequately considered in studies involving treatment practices for this group. The statement in the letter ?it is not possible to carry out this pathology to a dysfunction of a single tissue (fascia) and of a muscular structure? actually does not fully reflect the method that we applied in our study. In its updated definition of fascia, the Fascia Nomenclature Committee presents two different terminologies: ?a fascia? and ?the fascial system?.2 As Bordoni has also mentioned in the letter, the term ?a fascia? refers only to the planar tissues that can be dissected with a conventional scalpel. However, the second term ?the fascial system? refers to the increasingly popular concept of fascia as a body-wide interconnected fibrous network that has tensegrity properties. In our study, we applied the release method along the myofascial chain (superficial back line) based on the fascial system. In this way, we aimed to emphasize the importance of addressing rehabilitation from a full-body perspective rather than a specific pain and/or affected area, especially in cases of chronic pain. Yet, it is not mentioned anywhere in our study that the treatment for low-back pain should be solely composed of fascial and muscular approaches, but we argued that in this group of patients where myofascial pain is observed in 95.5%, the fascia should also be included in holistic treatment programs.

In addition to the anatomical studies, the effects of therapeutic interventions based on the myofascial chain have been shown in several studies. In their study, Grieve et al reported an increase in sit and reach test distance and hamstring flexibility in measurements taken immediately after the self-myofascial massage to the plantar fascia.3 Similarly, in another study, it was found that stretching gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles increased the mobility of the cervical spine in the sagittal plane.4 In an ultrasound-supported study by Montecinos-Cruz et al, the participants were asked to move their pelvis forward (anterior pelvic tilt) while their knees were in extension. In ultrasound images of the gastrocnemius, a simultaneous cranial displacement was observed in the fascia of this muscle.5 All these studies can be an indication of mechanical force transmission along the superficial back line. In individuals with low-back pain, it is reported that hamstring muscles, which are a part of the superficial back line, have stiffness and reduced flexibility, 6 and excessive activation of the erector spinae muscles along the same line is also demonstrated.7 Moreover, the sacrolumbar fascia, which is an important part of this chain, is also the junction of the thoracolumbar fascia.8 In their ultrasound examination, Langevin et al6 reported a decrease in shear?strain transmission in the lumbodorsal fascia in patients with chronic low-back pain. This change is thought to be caused by inflammation in the lumbodorsal fascia in individuals with low-back pain.9,10 According to current compelling evidence, nerve growth factor (NGF), which is produced by inflamed tissues, increases hyperalgesia (sensitivity to pain) and performs as a mediator in chronic pain conditions. Weinkauf et al have reported that a dose of NGF caused a more significant mechanical hyperalgesia in fascia than in muscle.11 Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the sensitization of fascia rather than muscle by NGF may contribute to the pathophysiology of low-back pain. Mense demonstrated that free nerve endings containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) in the thoracolumbar fascia 12 contribute to the sensitization of peripheral nerves by stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. When these peptides are released centrally, they also contribute to the pain?s central sensitization in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To identify the relevant cells in the dorsal root of the central nervous system, Barry et al reported that the innervation of these peptidergic neurons was three times denser in fascia than in muscle. Therefore, all these studies suggest that myofascial structures not only act as a tissue but also play a role among the central and peripheral components of pain. Despite the available data highlighting the role of myofascial force transfer in lumbar stability, studies investigating adapted treatments in individuals with low-back pain are insufficient. In this context, we planned our study to contribute to the literature.

Although Bordoni has criticized the use of ?superficial muscle group? for erector spinae muscles, this term is commonly used in the literature.13,14 Furthermore, there are clinical studies15,16 as well as systematic review and meta-analysis17 showing that core stabilization training is more effective than general exercises. Hence, we genuinely believe in the accuracy of what we wrote in the introduction section, and we believe that the different results in the literature will shed light on future studies.

In the letter, it is pinpointed that morphological changes in the disc and vertebral bodies were not examined in our study. Although spinal degenerative changes caused by aging (decreased amount of liquid in the cartilage tissue of the intervertebral discs, narrowing of the intervertebral spaces, more rigid and less flexible discs) cause low-back pain, not all abnormalities in the medical images of the lumbar spine are associated with low-back pain. Abnormal imaging phenotypes are commonly observed in asymptomatic elderly individuals.18,19 In magnetic resonance imaging, disc degeneration is more common in the elderly individuals; however, it is less likely to be a source of pain compared to young adults.20

As the last point, we strongly believe that the presence of a placebo group and/or a myofascial release group would be a great advantage for our study. In this regard, there is a need for future studies that include diaphragm (as indicated by Bordoni) as well as pelvic floor muscles.",PubMed
"Purpose:

This prospective, randomized and single-blinded study assesses the influence of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) in patients with low back pain (LBP).
Methods:

A total of 52 patients with LBP were enrolled in the study, out of which a homogeneous group of 40 patients with mean age of 53.45ñ4.9 years was included. Patients were randomized into group A (n=20) treated with rESWT (2000 pulses; 2.5 bars; 5 Hz, 7 mins) performed twice a week for five weeks (10 sessions) and stabilization training, as well as group B (n=20) treated with sham rESWT and stabilization training. To analyze the therapeutic progress, the following tests were performed (before and after therapy; 1 and 3 months follow-up) to assess pain and functional efficiency: (1) Visual Analog Scale (VAS), (2) Laitinen Pain Scale (LPS), and (3) Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
Results:

The control group had a statistically significant advantage over the rESWT group (4.4 vs. 3.1 points on the VAS; p=0.039). However, in long-term observations, group A gradually experienced more pain relief than group B (2.7 vs. 3.5 points, p>0.05, at one month and 2.0 vs. 4.4 points at three months after treatment; p<0.0001). Similar findings can be seen in the analysis of changes in pain sensations measured with the LPS. The functional state (ODI) was better in rESWT group, especially in follow-up observation (9.3 vs. 14.6 points, p=0.033, at one month and 9.3 vs. 17.8 points, p=0.004, at three months after treatment).
Conclusion:

The rESWT combined with stabilization training is particularly effective in the long-term and achieves a stable beneficial effect for patients with LBP. The use of rESWT has a significant long-term influence on the reduction of pain and the improvement of the general functional state in relation to the conventional motor improvement program.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Since 2000, guidelines have been consistent in recommending when diagnostic imaging for low back pain should be obtained to ensure patient safety and reduce unnecessary tests. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the pooled proportion of CT and x-ray imaging of the lumbar spine that were considered appropriate in primary and emergency care.
METHODS:

Pubmed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Embase were searched for synonyms of ""low back pain"", ""guidelines"", and ""adherence"" that were published after 2000. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were reviewed for inclusion with forward and backward tracking on included studies. Included studies had data extracted and synthesized. Risk of bias was performed on all studies, and GRADE was performed on included studies that provided data on CT and x-ray separately. A random effect, single proportion meta-analysis model was used.
RESULTS:

Six studies were included in the descriptive synthesis, and 5 studies included in the meta-analysis. Five of the 6 studies assessed appropriateness of x-rays; two of the six studies assessed appropriateness of CTs. The pooled estimate for appropriateness of x-rays was 43% (95% CI: 30%, 56%) and the pooled estimate for appropriateness of CTs was 54% (95% CI: 51%, 58%). Studies did not report adequate information to fulfill the RECORD checklist (reporting guidelines for research using observational data). Risk of bias was high in 4 studies, moderate in one, and low in one. GRADE for x-ray appropriateness was low-quality and for CT appropriateness was very-low-quality.
CONCLUSION:

While this study determined a pooled proportion of appropriateness for both x-ray and CT imaging for low back pain, there is limited confidence in these numbers due to the downgrading of the evidence using GRADE. Further research on this topic is needed to inform our understanding of x-ray and CT appropriateness in order to improve healthcare systems and decrease patient harms.",PubMed
"Purpose:

Essential to the successful management of patients with sacroiliac joint pain (SIJP) is understanding how these joints move. The innominates tilt together in the same direction with symmetrical activities (i.e. forward-bending) but move opposite of one another when performing asymmetrical activities (i.e. walking). How they move in patients with SIJP is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine inter-innominate movement (tilt) when assuming three different stance positions to describe how the innominate bones move in those with and without SIJP.
Study type:

Observational Cohort Study.
Methods:

Twenty-eight participants were classified into two groups; SIJP with low back pain (LBP), and no SIJP or LBP. SIJP participants were further classified into groups with left or right pelvic tilt. Pelvic tilt was measured during neutral standing and in both left-sided and right-sided reciprocal stance, with a full-stride (one hip fully flexed the other fully extended) and in a half-stride position, which mimic the double-stance phase of gait. A repeated measure ANOVA assessed for differences between Groups (Level, Left or Right Pelvic Tilt), stance side position (left/right), and stride length (full/half).
Results:

The was a significant Group main effect (F [2, 25] = 130.2, p?<?0.0001), and a significant Side main effect (F [1, 25] = 429.7, p?<?0.0001), qualified by a significant Side x Group interaction (F [2, 25] = 19.9 p?<?.0001). Follow-up comparisons showed that pelvic tilts for right and left stance were significantly different (p?<?0.05) for each group (Level, left and right pelvic tilt). For the right stance condition, all groups were significantly different from each other (p?<?0.05). For the left stance position, the right pelvic tilt and level pelvic tilt means were not different from each other (p?>?0.05), but each was different from the mean for the left pelvic tilt group (p?<?0.05).
Conclusions:

When assuming an asymmetrical stance position, the innominates tilt opposite of each other in those without SIJP. In patients with SIJP they behave in the normal fashion in one asymmetrical stance position but not the other. Instead of tilting opposite, as expected, the innominates remain symmetrical, dependent on the side of the presenting pelvic tilt.

"BACKGROUND:

We investigated the influence of sleeplessness and number of insomnia symptoms on the probability of recovery from chronic low back pain (LBP), and the possible interplay between sleeplessness and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain on this association.
METHODS:

The study comprised data on 3712 women and 2488 men in the Norwegian HUNT study who reported chronic LBP at baseline in 1995-1997. A modified Poisson regression model was used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for the probability of recovery from chronic LBP at follow-up in 2006-2008, associated with sleep problems and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain at baseline.
RESULTS:

Compared with persons without sleeplessness, persons who often/always experienced sleeplessness had a lower probability of recovery from chronic LBP (RR 0.65, 95%?CI 0.57 to 0.74 in women and RR 0.81, 95%?CI 0.69 to 0.95 in men). Although there was no clear evidence of statistical interaction between sleeplessness and co-occurring musculoskeletal pain, women and men who often/always experienced sleeplessness and had ò5 additional chronic pain sites had RRs of recovery of 0.40 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.48) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.78), respectively, compared with persons without sleeplessness and 1-2 chronic pain sites.
CONCLUSION:

These findings suggest that preventing or reducing sleep problems among people with chronic LBP may have the potential of improving the long-term prognosis of this condition, also among those with several additional pain sites.

"Low back pain (LBP) is a condition that is commonly experienced in people regardless of age and is prevalent in the older adult (individuals >65 yrs). Unfortunately, LBP research frequently excludes the older adult population due to age related co-morbidities. Clinical decision-making for this patient population is thus affected. As such, exercise prescription must be extrapolated from the available literature focused on chronic LBP, older adults without LBP, and younger adults with LBP. The aim of this paper is to review common exercise paradigms including strength, aerobic, and motor control training for treating LBP while discussing potential considerations in exercise prescription for the older adult population. Aside from previous episodes of LBP, predictive factors for development of LBP include poor back muscle endurance, perceived disability, depression/anxiety, fear avoidance, catastrophizing, and illness perception. Exercise is often considered unsafe in the older adult; however, there have been no reported serious cardiovascular incidents with exercise in the older adult from ages 80-100. While there is no clear superior exercise paradigm for the older adult with LBP, there is evidence that the older adult benefits from exercise in general. In addition, these benefits do not decrease with age.",PubMed
"Background:

Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.
Methods:

The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.
Results:

The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P < 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P < 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P < 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P < 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P < 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P < 0.05).
Discussion:

The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.

"STUDY DESIGN:

This is an observational cohort study.
OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of PT to an interdisciplinary treatment approach in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:

CLBP is a costly and potentially disabling condition. Physical therapy (PT), cognitive behavioral therapy, and interdisciplinary pain programs (IPPs) are superior to usual care. Empirical evidence is lacking to clearly support one treatment approach over another in patients with CLBP.
METHODS:

One hundred seventeen adult patients who completed an IPP for individuals with ò3 months of back pain were compared to 214 adult patients with similar characteristics who completed PT. The Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was the primary outcome measure. Additional measures included: PROMIS physical function, global health, social role satisfaction, pain interference, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and Patient Health Questionnaire. Patients who completed the IPP were matched by propensity score to a historical control group of patients who completed a course of PT. Change in functional disability was compared between IPP patients and matched controls. Patient-reported outcome measures were assessed pre to post participation in the IPP using paired t test and by calculating the proportion with clinically meaningful improvement.
RESULTS:

Propensity score matching generated 81 IPP and 81 PT patients. Patients enrolled in the IPP had significantly greater improvement in MDQ scores upon completion compared to patients in PT (15.8 vs. 7.1, P?<?0.001). The majority of IPP patients reached the threshold for clinically meaningful change of ò10 point reduction (60.5%) compared to 34.6% of PT patients, P?<?0.01. Patients in the IPP also showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in social role satisfaction, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
CONCLUSION:

CLBP patients in an IPP demonstrated greater functional improvements compared to similar patients participating in PT.
