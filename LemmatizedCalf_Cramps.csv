METHOD:

In a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study (NIS) data on the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of quinine sulfate were collected in daily medical management in adult patients with frequent and painful nocturnal leg cramps.
RESULTS:

In total 596 patients were included into the study. Of these, 568 patients finished the study as planned (95.3%). Number, duration and pain intensity of NLC were reduced in the majority of patients after 2 weeks of therapy with quinine sulfate 200 mg OD. Physicians rated global assessment of treatment effect as ""good"" and ""very good"" in 535 patients (92.4%) which was concurrent with the patients' rating (""good"" and ""very good"" by 534 patients = 92.2%), based on the full analysis set of 579 patients. Furthermore, quality of life and sleep were improved. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 35/592 patients (5.9%). Severe adverse events were not observed. The total incidence of therapy-associated adverse effects was comparable in the subgroup of patients with concomitant á-blocker therapy (149/592 patients, 25.2%; totally 10%, subgroup 10.1%). Efficacy and tolerability of quinine sulfate were evaluated as ""very good"" or ""good"" by the majority of physicians and patients.

Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease where a cramp-like leg pain is exhibited during walking, which affects gait and limits walking distance.

METHODS:

Following NHS ethical approval, 31 individuals with claudication (age 69?ñ?10 years, stature 1.7?ñ?0.9?m, mass 83.2?ñ?16.2?kg, ankle-brachial pressure index 0.55?ñ?0.14) were randomised in this cross-over trial. Gait parameters whilst walking with rocker-soled shoes were compared with control shoes at three intervals of pain-free walking, at onset of IC pain (initial claudication distance) and when IC intensifies and prevents them walking any further (absolute claudication distance). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed on gait variables.

When compared with control shoes, rocker-soled shoes reduced ankle power generation (mean 2.1 vs 1.6?W/kg, respectively; p?=?0.006) and altered sagittal kinematics of the hip, knee and ankle.

CONCLUSION: The present datum indicate that muscle cramp can induce hypertrophy in calf muscle, though lack high tension as a important anabolic stimulus.","Skeletal muscles usually cramp at short lengths, where the tension that can be exerted by muscle fibers is low. Since high tension is an important anabolic stimulus, it is questionable if cramps can induce hypertrophy and strength gains. In the present study we investigated if electrically induced cramps (EIMCs) can elicit these adaptations.
METHODS:

15 healthy male adults were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG; n=10) and a control group (CG; n=5). The cramp protocol (CP) applied twice a week to one leg of the IG, consisted of 3x6 EIMCs, of 5 s each. Calf muscles of the opposite leg were stimulated equally, but were hindered from cramping by fixating the ankle at 0ø plantar flexion (nCP).
RESULTS:

After six weeks, the cross sectional area of the triceps surae was similarly increased in both the CP (+9.0ñ3.4%) and the nCP (+6.8ñ3.7%). By contrast, force of maximal voluntary contractions, measured at 0ø and 30ø plantar flexion, increased significantly only in nCP (0ø: +8.5ñ8.8%; 30ø: 11.7ñ13.7%).
CONCLUSION:

The present data indicate that muscle cramps can induce hypertrophy in calf muscles, though lacking high tension as an important anabolic stimulus.","PubMed"
