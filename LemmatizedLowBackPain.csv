"Osteoarthritis ( OA ) be a major cause of joint pain and disability, and chondrocyte senescence be a key pathological process in OA and may be a target of new therapeutics. MicroRNA - 140 ( miR - 140 ) play a protective role in OA, but little be know about its epigenetic effect on chondrocyte senescence. In this study, we first validate the feature of chondrocyte senescence characterize by increase cell cycle arrest in the G0 / G1 phase and the expression of senescence - associate? - galactosidase ( SA -? Gal ), p16INK4a, p21, p53, and? H2AX in human knee OA. Then, we reveal in interleukin 1? ( IL - 1? ) - induce OA chondrocyte in vitro that pretransfection with miR - 140 effectively inhibit the expression of SA -? Gal, p16INK4a, p21, p53, and? H2AX. Furthermore, in vivo result from trauma - induce early - stage OA rat show that intra - articularly inject miR - 140 can rapidly reach the chondrocyte cytoplasm and induce molecular change similar to the in vitro result, result in a noticeable alleviation of OA progression. Finally, bioinformatics analysis predict the potential target of miR - 140 and a mechanistic network by which miR - 140 regulate chondrocyte senescence. Collectively, miR - 140 can effectively attenuate the progression of early - stage OA by retard chondrocyte senescence, contribute new evidence of the involvement of miR - mediate epigenetic regulation of chondrocyte senescence in OA pathogenesis.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of joint pain and disability, and chondrocyte senescence is a key pathological process in OA and may be a target of new therapeutics.

Multidisciplinary approach to osteoarthritis (OA) in older patients, whose functional decline is multifactorial and who present with multiple symptoms, has been long advocated, but it is still seldom implemented in daily practice. Therefore, further indications for the management of OA are eagerly awaited and should consider the specific clinical features of this population, including the presence of frailty and comorbidities. This clinical approach should be based both on well-grounded evidence and practical experience of experts in OA management. This manuscript comments the multidisciplinary integrated approach for OA management in the older population, according to the opinion of a multidisciplinary Panel of Experts.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:

This project was developed by a Steering Committee, which consisted of three experts that were identified by the Italian Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (Societ… Italiana di Medicina Fisica e Riabilitativa, SIMFER) and the Italian Society for Unified and Interdisciplinary Management of Musculoskeletal Pain and Algodystrophy (Societ… Italiana per la Gestione Unificata e Interdisciplinare del Dolore muscolo-scheletrico e dell'Algodistrofia, SI-GUIDA). The Steering Committee identified key evidence on the management of OA in the older through systematic research in MEDLINE and EMBASE, selected the most relevant paper among those identified, and defined some questions concerning current unmet needs in the management of symptomatic OA in the older accordingly. The Panel discussed the identified evidence and questions during two meetings.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:

The discussion was used to generate seven statements with relevance to clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS:

Older adults with symptomatic OA present multiple concomitant issues, including other diseases, marked pain, poly-pharmacy, and often poor psychological and/or socio-economical status. According to the above-described evidence, it is crucial that the approach to those patients is multidisciplinary and based on the use of dedicated tools. A combination of exercise, mechanical support and properly selected analgesic treatment will greatly help the management of the OA patient, improving at the same time his/her quality of life.","PubMed"

This study compares participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (the Minimal Invasive Treatment [MinT] trials) to participants in a related observational study with regard to their low back pain (LBP) symptom course.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:

Eligible patients were diagnosed with chronic LBP originating from the facet joints (N = 615) or sacroiliac (SI) joints (N = 533) and were treated with radiofrequency denervation and an exercise program. Randomized patients were compared to patients in the related observational study who fulfilled all RCT eligibility criteria (observational group 1) and to patients who did not fulfill at least one of the RCT eligibility criteria (observational group 2). Outcomes were pain intensity, treatment success, and functional status over a 3-month period. Longitudinal mixed-model analyses and linear regression models were applied to analyze the differences in outcomes between the RCT and observational study groups.
RESULTS:

No differences in symptom course were found between patients in the RCTs and patients in observational group 1. Patients with facet joint pain in observational group 2 had overall less treatment success (odds ratios [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.90), and less improvement in physical functioning (mean difference [MD], 5.82; 95% CI, 2.54-9.11) compared to the RCT patients. Patients with SI joint pain in observational group 2 had higher pain scores (MD, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.72), less treatment success (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96), and less improvement in physical functioning (MD, 7.16; 95% CI, 3.84-10.47) compared to the RCT patients.

Low back pain is a burden worldwide and biological, psychological, and social mechanisms play a role in its development and persistence. Current guidelines support care using the biopsychosocial model. However, biomedical constructs dominate clinician training, and it is unknown the extent to which health science students understand the psychosocial determinates of a patient's low back pain. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to report health science students' current knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain.
Methods:

A scoping review framework was used to search electronic databases for research examining health science students' knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. The nature and findings of the studies are highlighted using the data charting tool. Each study was analyzed to determine the type of outcome measurement used. Scores were compared to minimum accepted scores, between disciplines, as education advanced, and after educational modules.
Results:

Fourteen studies published between 2004 and 2019 were identified. Seven healthcare disciplines were represented.In total, 12 different measurement tools were utilized. In 9 studies students demonstrated inadequate knowledge of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. Three tools compared disciplines and nationalities. Three tools were associated with practice behavior. Eight studies showed improvement as students' education advanced, and 3 studies demonstrated improvements in knowledge after implementation of pain education modules of varied lengths. Of those, two showed significant improvement.
Conclusions:

Health science students in these studies had substandard understanding of psychosocial factors associated with low back pain. Dedicated pain education has the potential to improve low back pain understanding, resulting in more guideline appropriate care recommendation.

Non - Specific Low Back Pain In Elderly And The effect Of Myofascial Release Technique combine With Core Stabilization Exercise: Not Just muscle [ Letter ]? relate to our recently publish study. First of all, we would like to express our deep - seat thank to Professor Bordoni for his contribution. We believe that the idea express in correspondence with the editor will help to take a deep look into the literature and we be please to participate in this dialogue. The aim of our study entitle as? The effect Of Myofascial Release Technique combine With Core Stabilization Exercise In Elderly With Non - Specific Low Back Pain: A randomize control, Single - Blind Study? be to present a different perspective to the approach use in the treatment of low - back pain in elderly individual with take the role of fascia into consideration. Although non - specific low - back pain ( NSLBP ) be a complex condition, in a study conduct in elderly individual with chronic low - back pain? myofascial pain? be find to be in the first place with the rate of 95. 5 % as the much common symptom. 1 In spite of this high rate, myofascial structure have not be adequately consider in study involve treatment practice for this group. The statement in the letter? it be not possible to carry out this pathology to a dysfunction of a single tissue ( fascia ) and of a muscular structure? actually do not fully reflect the method that we apply in our study. In its update definition of fascia, the Fascia Nomenclature Committee present two different terminology:? a fascia? and? the fascial system?. 2 As Bordoni have also mention in the letter, the term? a fascia? refer only to the planar tissue that can be dissect with a conventional scalpel. However, the 2 term? the fascial system? refer to the increasingly popular concept of fascia as a body - wide interconnect fibrous network that have tensegrity property. In our study, we apply the release method along the myofascial chain ( superficial back line ) base on the fascial system. In this way, we aim to emphasize the importance of address rehabilitation from a full - body perspective rather than a specific pain and / or affect area, especially in case of chronic pain. Yet, it be not mention anywhere in our study that the treatment for low - back pain should be solely compose of fascial and muscular approach, but we argue that in this group of patient where myofascial pain be observe in 95. 5 %, the fascia should also be include in holistic treatment program. In addition to the anatomical study, the effect of therapeutic intervention base on the myofascial chain have be show in several study. In their study, Grieve et al report a increase in sit and reach test distance and hamstring flexibility in measurement take immediately after the self - myofascial massage to the plantar fascia. 3 Similarly, in another study, it be find that stretch gastrocnemius and hamstring muscle increase the mobility of the cervical spine in the sagittal plane. 4 In a ultrasound - support study by Montecinos - Cruz et al, the participant be ask to move their pelvis forward ( anterior pelvic tilt ) while their knee be in extension. In ultrasound image of the gastrocnemius, a simultaneous cranial displacement be observe in the fascia of this muscle. 5 All this study can be a indication of mechanical force transmission along the superficial back line. In individual with low - back pain, it be report that hamstring muscle, which be a part of the superficial back line, have stiffness and reduce flexibility, 6 and excessive activation of the erector spina muscle along the same line be also demonstrate. 7 Moreover, the sacrolumbar fascia, which be a important part of this chain, be also the junction of the thoracolumbar fascia. 8 In their ultrasound examination, Langevin et al6 report a decrease in shear? strain transmission in the lumbodorsal fascia in patient with chronic low - back pain. This change be think to be cause by inflammation in the lumbodorsal fascia in individual with low - back pain. 9, 10 accord to current compel evidence, nerve growth factor ( NGF ), which be produce by inflame tissue, increase hyperalgesia ( sensitivity to pain ) and perform as a mediator in chronic pain condition. Weinkauf et al have report that a dose of NGF cause a much significant mechanical hyperalgesia in fascia than in muscle. 11 base on this finding, it can be conclude that the sensitization of fascia rather than muscle by NGF may contribute to the pathophysiology of low - back pain. Mense demonstrate that free nerve ending contain calcitonin gene - relate peptide ( CGRP ) and substance P ( SP ) in the thoracolumbar fascia 12 contribute to the sensitization of peripheral nerve by stimulate pro - inflammatory cytokine. When this peptide be release centrally, they also contribute to the pain? s central sensitization in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To identify the relevant cell in the dorsal root of the central nervous system, Barry et al report that the innervation of this peptidergic neuron be three time dense in fascia than in muscle. Therefore, all this study suggest that myofascial structure not only act as a tissue but also play a role among the central and peripheral component of pain. Despite the available datum highlight the role of myofascial force transfer in lumbar stability, study investigate adapt treatment in individual with low - back pain be insufficient. In this context, we plan our study to contribute to the literature. Although Bordoni have criticize the use of? superficial muscle group? for erector spina muscle, this term be commonly use in the literature. 13, 14 Furthermore, there be clinical studies15, 16 as good as systematic review and meta - analysis17 show that core stabilization train be much effective than general exercise. Hence, we genuinely believe in the accuracy of what we write in the introduction section, and we believe that the different result in the literature will shed light on future study. In the letter, it be pinpoint that morphological change in the disc and vertebral body be not examine in our study.

Abnormal image phenotype be commonly observe in asymptomatic elderly individual. 18, 19 In magnetic resonance image, disc degeneration be much common in the elderly individual; however, it be little likely to be a source of pain compare to young adult. 20 As the last point, we strongly believe that the presence of a placebo group and / or a myofascial release group would be a great advantage for our study.

Unfortunately, LBP research frequently exclude the old adult population due to age relate co - morbidity. Clinical decision - make for this patient population be thus affect. As such, exercise prescription must be extrapolate from the available literature focus on chronic LBP, old adult without LBP, and young adult with LBP. The aim of this paper be to review common exercise paradigm include strength, aerobic, and motor control train for treat LBP while discuss potential consideration in exercise prescription for the old adult population. Aside from previous episode of LBP, predictive factor for development of LBP include poor back muscle endurance, perceive disability, depression / anxiety, fear avoidance, catastrophizing, and illness perception. Exercise be often consider unsafe in the old adult; however, there have be no report serious cardiovascular incident with exercise in the old adult from age 80 - 100. While there be no clear superior exercise paradigm for the old adult with LBP, there be evidence that the old adult benefit from exercise in general.

Unfortunately, LBP research frequently excludes the older adult population due to age related co-morbidities. Clinical decision-making for this patient population is thus affected. As such, exercise prescription must be extrapolated from the available literature focused on chronic LBP, older adults without LBP, and younger adults with LBP. The aim of this paper is to review common exercise paradigms including strength, aerobic, and motor control training for treating LBP while discussing potential considerations in exercise prescription for the older adult population. Aside from previous episodes of LBP, predictive factors for development of LBP include poor back muscle endurance, perceived disability, depression/anxiety, fear avoidance, catastrophizing, and illness perception. Exercise is often considered unsafe in the older adult; however, there have been no reported serious cardiovascular incidents with exercise in the older adult from ages 80-100. While there is no clear superior exercise paradigm for the older adult with LBP, there is evidence that the older adult benefits from exercise in general. In addition, these benefits do not decrease with age.","PubMed"
"Background: Compression of myofascial trigger point ( MTrPs ) in muscle be report to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) be implicate in development of chronic pain, the mechanism of how MTrP compression at low back region affect PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigate effect of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subject with chronic low back pain. method: The study be a prospective, randomize, parallel - group trial and a observer and subject - blind clinical trial.

Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.
Methods:

The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.
Results:

The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P < 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P < 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P < 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P < 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P < 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P < 0.05).

This is an observational cohort study.
OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of PT to an interdisciplinary treatment approach in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:

CLBP is a costly and potentially disabling condition. Physical therapy (PT), cognitive behavioral therapy, and interdisciplinary pain programs (IPPs) are superior to usual care. Empirical evidence is lacking to clearly support one treatment approach over another in patients with CLBP.
METHODS:

One hundred seventeen adult patients who completed an IPP for individuals with ò3 months of back pain were compared to 214 adult patients with similar characteristics who completed PT. The Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was the primary outcome measure. Additional measures included: PROMIS physical function, global health, social role satisfaction, pain interference, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and Patient Health Questionnaire. Patients who completed the IPP were matched by propensity score to a historical control group of patients who completed a course of PT. Change in functional disability was compared between IPP patients and matched controls. Patient-reported outcome measures were assessed pre to post participation in the IPP using paired t test and by calculating the proportion with clinically meaningful improvement.
RESULTS:

Propensity score matching generated 81 IPP and 81 PT patients. Patients enrolled in the IPP had significantly greater improvement in MDQ scores upon completion compared to patients in PT (15.8 vs. 7.1, P?<?0.001). The majority of IPP patients reached the threshold for clinically meaningful change of ò10 point reduction (60.5%) compared to 34.6% of PT patients, P?<?0.01. Patients in the IPP also showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in social role satisfaction, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.
CONCLUSION:

CLBP patients in an IPP demonstrated greater functional improvements compared to similar patients participating in PT.
