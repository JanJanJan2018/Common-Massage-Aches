"PURPOSE:

Compression of the sciatic nerve in its path along the piriformis muscle can produce sciatica-like symptoms. There are 6 predominant types of sciatic nerve variations with type 1 being the most common (84.2%), followed by type 2 (13.9%). However, there is scarce literature on the prevalence of sciatic nerve variation in those diagnosed with sciatica.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The charts of 95 patients clinically diagnosed with sciatica who had a magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis/hip were retrospectively studied. All patients had T1-weighted axial, coronal, and sagittal images. Magnetic resonance imagings were interpreted separately by 2 board-certified fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists to identify the sciatic nerve variant.
RESULTS:

Seven cases were excluded because of inadequate imaging. Of the remaining 88 patients, 5 had bilateral sciatica resulting in a sample size of 93 limbs. Fifty-two (55.9%) had type 1 sciatic nerve anatomy, 39 (41.9%) had type 2, and 2 (2.2%) had type 3. The proportions of type 1 and 2 variations were significantly different from the normal distribution (P < 0.001), whereas type 3, 4, 5, and 6 variants were not (P = 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS:

There is strong statistical significance regarding the relationship between sciatic nerve variation and the clinical diagnosis of sciatica. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging can be considered in sciatica patients to prevent iatrogenic injury in pelvic surgery.",PubMed
"Endometriosis (EN) is a common gynecological condition characterized by the presence of functional endometrium located outside the uterine cavity. Sciatic nerve (SN) is rarely affected by EN. Magnetic resonance imaging allows a direct visualization of the spinal and SN, and it is the modality of choice for the study of SN involvement in extrapelvic EN. We report a case of an endometrioma located in the right SN with a systematic review of the literature.",PubMed
"The sciatic nerve is the terminal branch of the sacral plexus. Sciatalgia is a nerve root pain. In most cases, sciatica originates from degenerative disc disease. Tumor involving the sciatic nerve is extremely rare. We here report the case of a 33-year old patient with nerve tumor detected on MRI performed for drug-resistant sciatica. Tumor involving the sciatic nerve is rare and diagnosis is difficult. MRI data are crucial for establishing an effective surgical approach.

"Carbonic anhydrase-8 (CA8) is an intracellular protein that functions as an allosteric inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor-1 (ITPR1) critical to intracellular Ca++ release, synaptic functions and neuronal excitability. We showed previously that murine nociception and analgesic responses are regulated by the expression of this gene in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) associated with a cis-eQTL. In this report, we identify an exon-level cis-eQTL (rs6471859) that regulates human DRG CA8 alternative splicing, producing a truncated 1,697bp transcript (e.g., CA8-204). Our functional genomic studies show the ""G"" allele at rs6471859 produces a cryptic 3'UTR splice site regulating expression of CA8-204. We developed constructs to study the expression and function of the naturally occurring CA8-204G transcript (G allele at rs6471859), CA8-204C (C allele at rs6471859 reversion mutation) and CA8-201 (full length transcript). CA8-204G transcript expression occurred predominantly in non-neuronal cells (HEK293), while CA8-204C expression was restricted to neuronal derived cells (NBL) in vitro. CA8-204G produced a stable truncated transcript in HEK293 cells that was barely detectable in NBL cells. We also show CA8-204 produces a stable peptide that inhibits pITPR1 and Ca++ release in HEK293 cells. These results imply homozygous G/G individuals at rs6471859, which are common in the general population, produce exclusively CA8-204G that is barely detectable in neuronal cells. CA8 null mutations that greatly impact neuronal functions are associated with severe forms of spinal cerebellar ataxia, and our data suggest G/G homozygotes should display a similar phenotype. To address this question, we show in vivo using AAV8-FLAG-CA8-204G and AAV8-V5-CA8-201 gene transfer delivered via intra-neural sciatic nerve injection (SN), that these viral constructs are able to transduce DRG cells and produce similar analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic responses to inflammatory pain. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) examinations of DRG tissues further show CA8-204G peptide is expressed in advillin expressing neuronal cells, but to a lesser extent compared to glial cells. These findings explain why G/G homozygotes that exclusively produce this truncated functional peptide in DRG evade a severe phenotype. These genomic studies significantly advance the literature regarding structure-function studies on CA8-ITPR1 critical to calcium signaling pathways, synaptic functioning, neuronal excitability and analgesic responses.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Peripheral nerve blocks reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of single-shot femoral nerve and sciatic nerve blocks on postoperative pain management and opioid consumption after TKA.
METHODS:

This study included 100 patients who underwent TKA between July 2015 and September 2017. Fifty patients received pre-operative, single-injection, ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic nerve blocks (Group 1) and 50 did not (Group 2). Multimodal analgesia was otherwise identical, and oxycodone was administered either intravenously or orally if the patients complained of postoperative pain ò6 on the visual analog scale (VAS). Postoperative VAS scores, opioid consumption, and the fear of future TKA were compared between the groups.
RESULTS:

The mean VAS in the first 18 postoperative hours was significantly lower in Group 1 (P?ó?0.002). The mean amount of oxycodone taken in the first three postoperative days was significantly lower in Group 1 (P?=?0.001). Patient fear of future TKA at 14?days postoperatively was significantly lower in Group 1 (P?=?0.027).
CONCLUSIONS:

Pre-operative ultrasound-guided, single-shot femoral and sciatic nerve blocks afforded effective pain control in the first 18?h after TKA, and significantly reduced oxycodone consumption in the first three postoperative days.

"INTRODUCTION:

An isolated injury to the tibial division is rare among compressive sciatic neuropathy. To date, isolated injury to the tibial division of the sciatic nerve after self-massage of the gluteal muscle has not been reported. Here, we report a case of compressive sciatic neuropathy diagnosed after self-massage of the gluteal muscle using magnetic resonance image (MRI) and ultrasound images and its associated therapeutic process.
PATIENT CONCERNS:

A 50-year-old woman presented right lower extremity pain for the past 7 days.
DIAGNOSIS:

Electrophysiological findings were consistent with right tibial neuropathy proximal to the branch to hamstring muscles. However, T2-weighted MRI showed high signal intensity and swelling in the right sciatic nerves from the superior gemellus level to the quadratus femoris level. After considering both radiologic and electrophysiological findings, the patient was diagnosed with an isolated injury to the tibial division of the right sciatic nerve.
INTERVENTIONS:

The patient agreed to an ultrasound-guided perineural steroid injection upon receiving detailed explanation of the procedure.
OUTCOMES:

After the injection, there was significant improvement in pain.
CONCLUSION:

Therefore, in making a diagnosis of sciatic neuropathy, it may be important to find the lesion via MRI than relying solely on the patient's history or electrophysiologic study.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of this study was to assess the endoscopic findings of the sciatic nerve and clinical outcomes of major traumatic sciatic nerve neuropathies after fracture or reconstructive surgery of the acetabulum with idiopathic deep gluteal syndrome (DGS) groups.
DESIGN:

Retrospective review of patient reports.
SETTING:

Level I trauma center of a tertiary university hospital.
PARTICIPANTS:

The study included 70 patients who consecutively underwent endoscopic sciatic nerve decompression. Patients who had previous fractures or reconstructive surgeries of the acetabulum were categorized as the major trauma group, whereas those without major trauma were categorized as the idiopathic group (45 patients) after a minimum of 24-months of follow-up period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

The results were evaluated using the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip outcome, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey scores, respectively.
RESULTS:

In the major trauma group, all patients with sensory symptoms showed some degree of relief after the endoscopic sciatic nerve release. None of the patients with complete foot drop demonstrated complete improvement. Three patients with motor weakness without foot drop showed complete improvement in motor function. The mean mHHS increased from 61.5 ñ 13.4 to 84.1 ñ 8.1 (P = 0.031). In the idiopathic DGS group, the mean mHHS increased from 73.8 ñ 10.3 to 94.4 ñ 5.3 (P = 0.003). The Benson outcomes rating in the major trauma group was statistically lower than that in the idiopathic DGS group.
CONCLUSION:

Endoscopic release of the sciatic nerve after fractures or reconstructive surgeries could provide some improvements without complications. However, more favorable outcomes were observed in the idiopathic DGS group.",PubMed
"AIMS:

People with chronic low back pain (CLBP) tend to have altered postural control. Visual biofeedback may be used to restore postural control. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of visual biofeedback on seated postural trunk control in subjects with CLBP, and to investigate the relationship between the postural control parameters and clinical tests.
METHODS:

Ten CLBP subjects (8 female, 2 male; age 40.6ñ5 yrs; BMI 25.06ñ2.93) and 10 healthy matched controls (8 female, 2 male; age 41.2ñ5.88 yrs; BMI 24.61ñ3.17) underwent seated postural assessment. Center of pressure (COP) parameters were collected under three experimental conditions: eyes-open, visual biofeedback, and eyes-closed.
RESULTS:

The results revealed that COP velocity was significantly different between healthy and CLBP subjects for each condition, both healthy and CLBP subjects had no differences in COP parameters between eyes-open and visual biofeedback conditions, and in subjects with CLBP, the straight leg raise clinical test had a strong negative correlation with all COP parameters.
CONCLUSIONS:

Our results suggest that 30-second visual biofeedback training did not improve the seated postural control of CLBP subjects, potentially due to the short duration of training, and that hamstrings muscle tightness or decreased sciatic nerve mobility was associated with worse postural control.",PubMed
"AIMS:

To explore the association of self-reported physical fitness with bodily, lumbar and sciatic pain, and pain disability during pregnancy.
METHODS:

The present study sample comprised 159 pregnant women (32.9 ñ 4.7 years old). Self-reported physical fitness was assessed with the International Fitness Scale (IFIS), where higher scores indicate greater physical fitness. Bodily pain was assessed with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), where higher scores indicate lower pain. Lumbar and sciatic pain were measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire was employed to assess the disability resulting from pain. Measures were assessed at 16th and 34th gestational weeks (g. w.).
RESULTS:

Pregnant women showed low-moderate pain during pregnancy course. Most of them showed medium self-reported overall physical fitness. At 16th g. w., greater self-reported overall physical fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with less bodily and lumbar pain, and pain disability (all, P < 0.05). Greater muscular strength was associated with less bodily pain and pain disability (both, P < 0.05). Greater speed-agility was associated with less bodily pain (P < 0.01) and less pain disability (P < 0.05). Self-reported flexibility was not associated with any outcome (P > 0.05). At 34th g. w., greater overall physical fitness and its components were associated with less bodily and sciatic pain (all, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION:

Greater self-reported overall physical fitness and its components are associated with less bodily, lumbar and sciatic pain, and reduced pain disability during pregnancy. Future studies are needed to explore whether increasing physical fitness before and during pregnancy could decrease pain in this relevant stage.

"Although cocaine induced myopathy and myotoxicity are described in the literature, we report a rare case of cocaine induced paraspinal myositis presenting with acute sciatic symptoms. A 35-year-old man presented with acute left-sided sciatica and was discharged from the emergency department (ED). He subsequently attended ED the following day in severe pain and bilateral sciatic symptoms, but denied symptoms of neurogenic bowel/bladder disturbance. Clinical examination was limited by severe pain: focal midline lumbar tenderness was elicited on palpation, per rectal and limb examinations were within normal limits with no significant neurological deficit. He was admitted for observation and pain management. His blood tests revealed a leucocyte count of 21.5?109/L, C reactive protein of 89?mg/L and deranged renal function with creatinine of 293 ?mol/L. An urgent lumbar spine MRI was arranged to rule out a discitis or epidural abscess. Lumbar MRI did not demonstrate any features of discitis but non-specific appearances of paraspinal inflammation raised the suspicion of a paraspinal myositis. Creatinekinase (CK) was found to be 66329 IU/L and a detailed history revealed he was a cocaine user. Paraspinal muscle biopsy confirmed histological features compatible with myositis. Other serological tests were negative, including anti-GBM, ANCA, ANA, Rheumatoid factor, Hep B, Hep C, myositis specific ENA, Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Rickettsia, Leptospira, EBV and CMV. There was good clinical response to treatment with prednisolone 20?mg OD with an improvement in renal function, CK levels and CRP. He had resumed normal activities and return to work at 6-week follow-up. A detailed social history including substance misuse is important in patients presenting to the ED-especially in cases of severe musculoskeletal pain with no obvious localising features. Drug induced myotoxicity, although rare, can result in symptomatic patients with severe renal failure.

"BACKGROUND:

Little is known about the neuromuscular morphometric characteristics in patients with sciatica.
OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the possible changes of nerve and muscle structures in patients with low back pain with unilateral radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation by ultrasound imaging.
DESIGN:

A case-control observational study.
METHODS:

Forty individuals were divided into case (n?=?20; low back pain with unilateral radiculopathy due to disc herniation), and healthy control groups (n?=?20). The thickness of lumbar multifidus at L5 level, and of lower limb muscles (i.e., biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and soleus) was measured during both rest and full contraction to calculate the rest/contraction ratio of these muscles. Additionally, the sciatic nerve cross-sectional area and the echogenicity of the nerve and muscles were measured based on ultrasound imaging. The association between severity of low back pain radiculopathy (i.e., pain and patients' perceived disability) and rest/contraction ratio was assessed.
RESULTS:

Patients with sciatica showed sciatic nerve enlargement, and different contraction ratios for multifidus (at L5)/ankle plantar flexors compared to the controls. The rest/contraction ratio for biceps femoris was similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSION:

According to these findings, ultrasound imaging can be considered a useful tool to detect changes in the sciatic nerve and muscles due to disc herniation. Furthermore, regarding the observation of significant changes in muscle rest/contraction ratio in the multifidus and gastrosoleus, one might attribute these changes to the nerve root compression.

"BACKGROUND:

The number of patients operated on for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is growing worldwide. Outpatient surgery is defined by a length of stay (LOS) in the hospital of less than 12?h. This can be limited for TKA, with the efficient management of pain and perioperative complications, such as blood loss, affecting a safe hospital discharge. Outpatient TKA with a suitable protocol, including multimodal measures, could improve the success rate of this procedure. Among the main measures, single-shot sciatic nerve block in association with continuous femoral nerve block for pain control needs to be evaluated in outpatient TKA. Furthermore, to promote the safety of the postoperative period and to accelerate rehabilitation, patients who undergo ambulatory TKA could be discharged to a rehabilitation center on the day of surgery to screen adverse events and to optimize the rehabilitation process. This study is designed to assess the benefits of sciatic nerve block in postoperative pain relief for outpatient TKA.
METHODS/DESIGN:

This randomized prospective controlled study will be conducted in the knee unit of the teaching hospital of the Nice university and will include 40 patients undergoing primary unilateral outpatient TKA, discharged the day of surgery to a private rehabilitation center for enhanced recovery after surgery, after a hospital stay of less than 12?h. Before surgery, all patients will receive a continuous femoral nerve block with 2?mg/ml ropivacaine 20?ml, and then patients will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive a single-shot sciatic nerve block with 2?mg/ml ropivacaine, 20?ml. The primary outcome measure is the success rate of outpatient TKA. This rate is defined by patients discharged from the hospital to a rehabilitation center the day of surgery with no re-hospitalization due to insufficient pain control before the fifth postoperative day. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of major and minor adverse events during the first five postoperative days and measurement of the quality of recovery using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and the new International Knee Society scores plus the Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire.
DISCUSSION:

The assessment of anesthesia and rehabilitation protocols enabling major orthopedic surgery, such as TKA, is necessary. This randomized controlled study will address the hypothesis that a suitable multimodal protocol including sciatic nerve block could improve pain control and thus improve the success rate of outpatient TKA.

"BACKGROUND:

Local infiltration anaesthesia (LIA) was introduced as an innovative analgesic procedure for enhanced recovery after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, LIA has never been compared with analgesia based on an adductor canal catheter and a single-shot sciatic nerve block.
OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate two analgesic regimens for TKA comparing mobility, postoperative pain and patient satisfaction.
DESIGN:

Two-group randomised, controlled clinical trial.
SETTING:

Charit-Universittsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charit Mitte, Germany between April and August 2017.
PATIENTS:

Adults undergoing primary TKA under general anaesthesia were eligible for study participation. Exclusion criteria were heart insufficiency (New York Heart Association class >2), liver insufficiency (Child Pugh Score >B), evidence of diabetic polyneuropathy, severe obesity (BMI?>?40?kg?m), chronic opioid therapy for more than 3 months before scheduled surgery and allergy to local anaesthetics.
INTERVENTIONS:

Nerve block patients group (n=20) underwent surgery with two ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia blocks: a single-shot sciatic nerve block with 20?ml of ropivacaine 0.75% combined with an adductor canal block with a catheter placed for less than 4 days with an infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at a rate of 6?ml?h. LIA patients (LIA group, n=20) received LIA of the knee capsule at the end of surgery with 150?ml of ropivacaine 0.2%.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

The primary endpoint was postoperative time to patient mobilisation (ability to walk) on the ward.
RESULTS:

Baseline characteristics were similar in each study group. Patients in both groups were mobilised to walk after TKA in similar time frames (LIA 24.0?h versus nerve block 27.1?h, 95% CI of difference -9.6 to 3.3?h). Maximum postoperative pain scores on exertion were higher in LIA patients with a mean 1.3 of 10 numerical rating scale points (95% CI 0.3 to 2.3, P?=?0.010) as were intra-operative opioid requirements (LIA median 107 [IQR 100 to 268]?mg versus nerve block median 78 [60 to 98]?mg, P?<?0.001). Patient satisfaction, postoperative oral morphine-equivalents and resting pain levels were comparable between groups. Anaesthesia induction time was reduced in LIA patients (LIA 10?min versus nerve block 35?min, 95% CI of difference 13 to 38?min, P?<?0.001).
CONCLUSION:

Both analgesic regimens allow early mobilisation after TKA with high patient satisfaction. LIA shortened peri-operative time. Further research is required to optimise especially pain control during the later postoperative period with LIA.

"Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a rare etiology of extra-spinal sciatica in which pathologies associated with or around the piriformis muscle (PM) irritate the adjacent sciatic nerve (SN), however, there is scarcity in the literature regarding its exact etiologies, thus, we performed a retrospective study to elucidate the epidemiology of PS and assess various causes of the syndrome. Our study included patients assessed at our institution who presented with sciatica of non-spinal origin between May 2014 and December 2015. Radiology reports of all patients who received pelvic MRI were examined for positive findings involving PM and SN. Of the 143 patients recognized with sciatica and negative lumbar pathology, 24 patients (17%) exhibited positive PM and SN findings. Average patient age was 50.0?ñ?15.1?years (range: 21-75), and 17 were female. Seven patients (5%; 4M/3F) presented with tumor, seven patients (5%) had chronic inflammatory changes, one patient had SN adhesions to obturator muscle, three patients (2%, 3F) had aberrant anatomy, and the remaining patients had positive MRI findings, such as nerve atrophy or PM hypertrophy without identifiable cause. Seven patients received steroid injections in the peri-sciatic fossa, and four displayed poor response. Our findings suggested possible trends in extra-spinal sciatica. Affected males appeared more likely to present with tumor, while affected females were more likely to present younger, but with aberrant anatomy. Steroid injections appeared to be suboptimal in most cases. Pelvic MRI is helpful in patients with sciatica and negative spine imaging to rule out neoplastic involvement.

Patient 2 represented to hospital with worsening mobility, neuropathic pain, and facial asymmetry. An FDG PET/CT demonstrated relapse within the spinal cord, left sciatic nerve, and facial nerve branches.

"BACKGROUND:

Many studies on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) had been undertaken to explore its pain relieving efficiency on several medicals/surgical conditions but none, specifically, had been carried out to determine the effect it has on post-injection sciatic pain (PISP) which comes about from wrong administration of intramuscular pain. This study aims to assess the effects of TENS in the management of PISP.
METHODS:

A total of 72 PISP subjects comprising 40 test subjects and 32 control subjects participated in a non-randomized controlled clinical trial in the current study. Participants were recruited from Department of Physiotherapy, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi and Landmark Physiotherapy Services, Nnewi. The participants were however blinded to the intervention method they will receive before being allotted conveniently to test/experimental group (TG) or control group (CG). A written informed consent was obtained from participants before enrollments in the study. TENS and sham TENS (STENS) was applied to 40 test and 32 subjects respectively, 3 times a week, and 1 hour per session for the 10?weeks the study lasted. The Visual Analogue Scale was used to collect baseline data as well as those of 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th weeks after TENS and STENS interventions. The data analysis was performed with the Descriptive statistic of Mean?ñ?SD, mean comparison test, repeated analysis of variance and paired wise t-test. Statistical level of significance was set at P?<?0.05.
RESULT:

Results of repeated measure ANOVA showed that the pain level among participants in the treatment group at the end (after 10 weeks) of the intervention was significantly lower than that of their counterparts in the control group (F?=?16.26; p?=?0.01); with the intervention accounting for the 19% of the variance. The effect size (partial eta squared)?=?0.19.
CONCLUSION:

The outcome of this research has proved the effectiveness of TENS in the management of PISP and is being recommended in the management of PISP.

"AM1710 (3-(1,1-dimethyl-heptyl)-1-hydroxy-9-methoxy-benzo(c) chromen-6-one), a cannabilactone cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist, suppresses chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in rodents without producing tolerance or unwanted side effects associated with CB1 receptors; however, the signaling profile of AM1710 remains incompletely characterized. It is not known whether AM1710 behaves as a broad-spectrum analgesic and/or suppresses the development of opioid tolerance and physical dependence. In vitro, AM1710 inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and produced enduring activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing mCB2. Only modest species differences in the signaling profile of AM1710 were observed between HEK cells stably expressing mCB2 and hCB2. In vivo, AM1710 produced a sustained inhibition of paclitaxel-induced allodynia in mice. In paclitaxel-treated mice, a history of AM1710 treatment (5 mg/kg per day ? 12 day, i.p.) delayed the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine and attenuated morphine-induced physical dependence. AM1710 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not precipitate CB1 receptor-mediated withdrawal in mice rendered tolerant to ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol, suggesting that AM1710 is not a functional CB1 antagonist in vivo. Furthermore, AM1710 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not suppress established mechanical allodynia induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL). Similarly, prophylactic and chronic dosing with AM1710 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not produce antiallodynic efficacy in the CFA model. By contrast, gabapentin suppressed allodynia in both CFA and PSNL models. Our results indicate that AM1710 is not a broad-spectrum analgesic agent in mice and suggest the need to identify signaling pathways underlying CB2 therapeutic efficacy to identify appropriate indications for clinical translation.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an entrapment of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, or myofascial pain from the piriformis muscle.
OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Mannitol plus Vitamins B regime in the management of PS.
METHODS:

Twenty two patients were included in this study and received 250 ml of mannitol 20% intravenous infusion for 5 days + Vitamins B (vitamin B1 10 mg + vitamin B2 10 mg + vitamin B12 50 ?g PO) for 6 weeks. Clinical outcomes were assessed systematically by clinical tests (tenderness, FAIR test, Beatty's, Freiberg's and Pace's maneuver), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Likert Analogue Scale (LAS), and MR examination.
RESULTS:

The clinical evaluations showed a significant reduction (p< 0.05) of tenderness, FAIR test, Beatty's maneuver, Freiberg's maneuver and Pace's maneuver when compared with baseline evaluation during the 3rd and 6th month follow-ups. A statistically significant improvement of pain was measured by NRS at resting (p< 0.001), at night (p< 0.001) and during activities (p< 0.001) and LAS with prolonged sitting (p< 0.001), standing (p< 0.001) and lying (p< 0.001). Concomitantly, swelling of SN revealed a significant reduction (p= 0.003) from 86.4% to 18.2%.
CONCLUSIONS:

Mannitol plus Vitamins B is effective in the management of piriformis syndrome and it could be an alternative regime in treating PS.",PubMed
"Background:

Ultrasound imaging has been suggested for studying the structure and function of nerves and muscles; however, reliability studies are limited to support the usage. The main aim of this study was to explore the intrarater within-session reliability of evaluating the sciatic nerve and some related muscles morphology by ultrasound imaging.
Methods:

Three B-mode images from two scans (transverse and longitudinal) were acquired from the multifidus, biceps femoris, soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally from 15 participants with sciatica and 15 controls in one session, 1-h apart. The data were collected from March to July 2017. Contraction ratio was measured only by longitudinal scan, while the echo intensity was measured using maximum rectangular region of interest in two scans (transverse and longitudinal) for all muscles. Cross-sectional area, direct (tracing) and indirect (ellipsoid formula) methods were used to measure the sciatic nerve. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1), standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change were calculated.
Results:

Good to high ICCs (0.80-0.96) were found for muscle contraction ratio in the longitudinal scans in all the muscles in both sciatica and control groups. For echo intensity measurements ICCs ranged from moderate to high, with higher ICCs seen with the maximum region of interest in the transverse scans. The minimal detectable change values ranged between 0.11 and 0.53 cm for contraction ratio.
Conclusions:

Ultrasound imaging has high intrarater within-session reliability for assessing the sciatic nerve Cross-sectional area and muscle contraction ratios. Transverse scans with the maximum region of interest result in higher reliability. The sciatic Cross-sectional area is most accurately measured utilizing the direct tracing method rather than the indirect ellipsoid method.

"The piriformis muscle is clinically implicated in pain disorders, posterior approaches for total hip arthroplasty, and iatrogenic injury to the muscle and the surrounding nerves. The piriformis muscle has been said to receive innervation from L5 to S3 ventral rami with most sources using S1 and S2 ventral rami as the most common innervation this muscle. However, descriptions of the nerve in the literature are vague. Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the anatomy of the nerve supply to the piriformis muscle. Twenty sides from ten fresh-frozen cadavers were studied. Specifically, via anterior dissection of the sacral plexus, branches to the piriformis were identified. Once identified, the nerves to the piriformis muscle were traced proximally to clarify their origin. Nerves supplying the piriformis muscle existed on all sides. On 80% of sides, the piriformis was innervated by two to three nerves. The origin of these nerves was from the superior gluteal nerve on 14 sides (70%), inferior gluteal nerve on one side (5%), L5 ventral ramus on one side (5%), S1 ventral ramus on 17 sides (85%), and S2 ventral ramus on 14 sides (70%), respectively. The most common nerve branches to the piriformis are from the superior gluteal nerve, and the ventral rami of S1 and S2. Based on our study, a single ""nerve to piriformis"" does not exist in the majority of specimens thus this term should be abandoned. Clin. Anat. 32:282-286, 2019.
