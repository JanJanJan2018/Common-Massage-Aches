Fibromyalgia is a heterogeneous condition that appears to be associated with physiological and biochemical disturbances of pain modulation, and that consequently affects numerous other facets of life. Tramadol is currently being explored as an option to manage fibromyalgia pain and other symptoms because of its inhibitory activity of reuptake of neurotransmitters, but its safety and efficacy have not yet been established in these patients.
OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol on the management of symptoms of the syndrome.
METHODS:

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Opengrey, ClinicalTrials. gov, and WHO-ICTRP for randomized controlled trials analyzing the association between tramadol used for fibromyalgia either single-agent or in combination with other drugs. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for all included studies.

Four RCTs comprising 459 patients were included. Tramadol-either as a single-agent or in combination with an antidepressant or analgesic-had a positive effect on pain.

Group mean for pain decrease, as report by average daily diary and Brief Pain Inventory, with great home practice minute associate with a great decrease in pain.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain disorder characterized by negative affect, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. This uncontrolled pilot study investigated the efficacy of daily yoga-based exercise to improve FM symptoms and explored baseline phenotypic characteristics associated with the greatest benefit.
Methods:

FM patients (n=46, with 36 completers) reported psychosocial functioning and a range of FM symptoms using validated instruments before and after participation in Satyananda yoga, which included weekly in-person pain-tailored group classes for 6 weeks and daily home yoga video practice.
Results:

Changes in FM symptoms from pre- to post-yoga were variable amongst participants. Group means for pain decreased, as reported by average daily diary and Brief Pain Inventory, with greater home practice minutes associated with a greater decrease in pain. Average daily ratings of sleep and fatigue improved. Pain catastrophizing was decreased overall, with greater change correlated to a decrease in FM symptoms. We did not observe any group mean changes in actigraphy sleep efficiency, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-anxiety and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Multilevel Modeling analysis revealed a significant interaction between anxiety and catastrophizing for end-study sleep efficiency, fatigue, and pain, such that patients with higher baseline catastrophizing and lower baseline anxiety reported less pain and fatigue, and higher sleep efficiency after the sixth week of yoga practice.
Conclusion:

This pilot study suggests that yoga may reduce pain and catastrophizing, as well as improve sleep, but these changes were modest across study participants. Greater uptake of home yoga practice as well as a phenotype of higher baseline catastrophizing combined with lower baseline anxiety were associated with greater impact. Future randomized, controlled trials comparing different types of yoga or exercise will allow determination of the most effective treatments for FM and allow closer targeting to the patients who will benefit most from them.","PubMed"

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a central nervous system disorder characterized by widespread mechanical hyperalgesia due to unknown mechanisms.

Materials and Methods:

Chronic FM pain was induced in mice by dual acid saline injection lasting up to 4 weeks.
Results:

Chronic FM pain was treated by EA manipulation, but not in the sham operated group. Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pPI3K), protein kinase B, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were unaltered in the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord (SC) after inducing FM and administering EA treatment. The pPI3K-associated nociceptive signaling pathway was increased in the thalamus of FM mice, but reversed by EA. Similar results were observed in the mouse somatosensory cortex.
