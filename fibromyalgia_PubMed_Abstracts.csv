"To compare the efficacy of intermittent and consecutive balneological outpatient treatment (hydrotherapy and peloidotherapy) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). A parallel 1:1, single-blind, pilot study was performed. Patients were recruited from musculoskeletal disorders outpatient clinic. Eligible participants were patients aged 18-60, diagnosed as FMS according to ACR 2010 criteria. They were randomly assigned to either consecutive or intermittent treatment groups. Both groups received 20 min of full body immersion in a tap water pool at 38-39 øC and 30 min of mud pack application on the back region at 45 øC. Delivery of the treatment was five times weekly during 2 weeks in consecutive group and two times weekly during 5 weeks in intermittent group. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and the number of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) on Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) at the 1st month after the completion of the treatment. Statistical analyses were based on intention to treat method. The assessing physician was blinded. Pain intensity significantly decreased in all post-treatment evaluations of both groups (except after treatment in the intermittent group). There was no significant difference between the groups. MCID for FIQ was achieved in 6 (24%) patients in the consecutive group and 12 (48%) in the intermittent group at the 1st month. There was no statistical difference in the secondary judgment criteria. The consecutive and intermittent deliveries of balneological outpatient treatment (hydrotherapy and peloidotherapy) seem to have similar effects on the clinical status of patients with FMS.

"The objective of the present study was to experimentally assess the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for the improvement of subjective well-being, trait emotional intelligence (TEI), mental health, and resilience in a sample of women with fibromyalgia (FM). The sample consisted of 104 women, between 29 and 77 years old (M = 47.59; SD = 5.93). The measures used were as follows: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Positive and Negative Affection Scale (PANAS), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form (TEIQue-SF), Mental Health Questionnaire (MH-5), and Resilience Scale (ER-14). A quasi-experimental design of repeated measures with a control group (CG) was used: before and after the application of the treatment and a follow-up assessment 6 months after the completion of the intervention. In order to assess the effect of the program, the participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control conditions. In the pretest evaluation, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were carried out. In the post-test evaluation, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) of the study variables as a whole was performed. Then, descriptive analyses and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the post-test scores (covariate pretest score) were performed. In the follow-up evaluation, a MANCOVA of the study variables as a whole was performed. Then, descriptive and ANCOVA analyses of the follow-up scores (covariate pretest score) were performed. In addition, the effect size was calculated using partial eta-squared (?2). The post-test results confirmed statistically significant differences in satisfaction with life (SWL), positive affect (PA), mental health, and resilience. The follow-up results showed statistically significant differences in SWL, PA, TEI, mental health, and resilience. The study provides an effective intervention tool that has been validated experimentally. The general results allow the emphasis of the importance of the implementation of MBIs framed in non-pharmacological treatments in FM.

"BACKGROUND:

Fibromyalgia is a heterogeneous condition that appears to be associated with physiological and biochemical disturbances of pain modulation, and that consequently affects numerous other facets of life. Tramadol is currently being explored as an option to manage fibromyalgia pain and other symptoms because of its inhibitory activity of reuptake of neurotransmitters, but its safety and efficacy have not yet been established in these patients.
OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tramadol on the management of symptoms of the syndrome.
METHODS:

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Opengrey, ClinicalTrials. gov, and WHO-ICTRP for randomized controlled trials analyzing the association between tramadol used for fibromyalgia either single-agent or in combination with other drugs. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for all included studies. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
RESULTS:

Four RCTs comprising 459 patients were included. Tramadol-either as a single-agent or in combination with an antidepressant or analgesic-had a positive effect on pain. Tramadol combined with analgesic showed improved quality of life over placebo as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire at 91 days. However, this difference did not hold for tramadol as a single agent against placebo. The evidence in these articles was rated ""low"" using the GRADE approach. No serious adverse events were reported. No improvement in depression and quality of sleep were observed.
CONCLUSIONS:

This systematic review found a dearth of clinical trials on tramadol in patients with fibromyalgia. Although the combination of monoamine and opioid mechanism of tramadol has shown positive effects for fibromyalgia, the available evidence is not sufficient to support or refute the use of tramadol in clinical practice for pain or symptom management.",PubMed
"Background:

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain disorder characterized by negative affect, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. This uncontrolled pilot study investigated the efficacy of daily yoga-based exercise to improve FM symptoms and explored baseline phenotypic characteristics associated with the greatest benefit.
Methods:

FM patients (n=46, with 36 completers) reported psychosocial functioning and a range of FM symptoms using validated instruments before and after participation in Satyananda yoga, which included weekly in-person pain-tailored group classes for 6 weeks and daily home yoga video practice.
Results:

Changes in FM symptoms from pre- to post-yoga were variable amongst participants. Group means for pain decreased, as reported by average daily diary and Brief Pain Inventory, with greater home practice minutes associated with a greater decrease in pain. Average daily ratings of sleep and fatigue improved. Pain catastrophizing was decreased overall, with greater change correlated to a decrease in FM symptoms. We did not observe any group mean changes in actigraphy sleep efficiency, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-anxiety and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Multilevel Modeling analysis revealed a significant interaction between anxiety and catastrophizing for end-study sleep efficiency, fatigue, and pain, such that patients with higher baseline catastrophizing and lower baseline anxiety reported less pain and fatigue, and higher sleep efficiency after the sixth week of yoga practice.
Conclusion:

This pilot study suggests that yoga may reduce pain and catastrophizing, as well as improve sleep, but these changes were modest across study participants. Greater uptake of home yoga practice as well as a phenotype of higher baseline catastrophizing combined with lower baseline anxiety were associated with greater impact. Future randomized, controlled trials comparing different types of yoga or exercise will allow determination of the most effective treatments for FM and allow closer targeting to the patients who will benefit most from them.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVES:

To determine the psychopathological profile of patients with central sensitization (CS) in a sample of knee osteoarthritis, with and without CS, and fibromyalgia, and to compare their psychopathological profiles.
METHODS:

The final sample consists of 19 patients with osteoarthritis and CS (mean 66.37 years ñ 8.77), 41 osteoarthritis patients without CS (mean 66.8 ñ 7.39 years), 47 fibromyalgia patients (mean 46.47 years ñ 7.92) and 26 control subjects (mean 51.56 years ñ 11.41). The psychopathological profile was evaluated with the Millon Multiaxial Clinical Inventory.
RESULTS:

The average score of MCMI-III reflect higher scores in the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis-CS groups. Patients with osteoarthritis-CS are more likely to report larger scores in Borderline and Major Depression scales. Fibromyalgia patients are more likely to report more increased scores in Somatoform and Major Depression, versus osteoarthritis-CS group. Fibromyalgia patients versus osteoarthritis without CS are more likely to report higher scores in Schizoid, Depression, Histrionic, Sadistic, Borderline, Somatoform, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depression scales.
DISCUSSION:

Patients with CS have less differences in their psychopathological profiles as well as in both osteoarthritis groups and greatest differences are obtained between the fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis without CS, so perhaps presence of CS is the key to differentiate those groups and not chronic pain. An exhaustive assessment brings more accurate psychopathological profiles, thus better psychological treatment could be applied.",PubMed
"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health issue with a variety of ill health consequences associated with exposure. Due to the stimulation of chronic stress and inflammatory pathways, childhood abuse has been associated with the subsequent development of functional syndromes such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although IPV in women appears to elicit similar biochemical responses, this association has not been tested thoroughly in IPV survivors. These functional syndromes are complex in etiology and any indication of their risk factors would benefit health care professionals managing this population. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between exposure to IPV with functional syndromes: fibromyalgia and CFS. We conducted a retrospective open cohort study using ""The Heath Improvement Network"" database between January 1, 1995 and December 1, 2017. A total of 18,547 women who were exposed to IPV were each matched by age to four controls who were not exposed (n = 74,188). The main outcome measures were the risk of developing fibromyalgia and CFS. These were presented as adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that 97 women in the exposed group developed fibromyalgia (incidence rate [IR] = 1.63 per 1,000 person-years) compared to 239 women in the unexposed group (IR = 0.83 per 1,000 person-years). Following adjustment, this translated to an IRR of 1.73 (95% CI = [1.36, 2.22]). Similarly, 19 women developed CFS in the exposed group (IR = 0.32 per 1,000 person-years), compared to 53 in the unexposed group (0.18 per 1,000 person-years), which translates to an aIRR of 1.92 (95% CI = [1.11, 3.33]). Therefore, we have identified an association between a history of IPV in women and the development of these functional syndromes, which may provide more information to inform the biopsychosocial pathway precipitating the development of fibromyalgia and CFS.",PubMed
"Objectives:

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a central nervous system disorder characterized by widespread mechanical hyperalgesia due to unknown mechanisms. Several inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor, are increased in the serum of FM patients. Although medications including pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran are used to treat FM, the results are unsatisfying. In the present study we assessed whether electroacupuncture (EA) can reduce chronic FM pain and then proposed an underlying mechanism for this effect.
Materials and Methods:

Chronic FM pain was induced in mice by dual acid saline injection lasting up to 4 weeks.
Results:

Chronic FM pain was treated by EA manipulation, but not in the sham operated group. Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pPI3K), protein kinase B, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were unaltered in the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord (SC) after inducing FM and administering EA treatment. The pPI3K-associated nociceptive signaling pathway was increased in the thalamus of FM mice, but reversed by EA. Similar results were observed in the mouse somatosensory cortex.
Conclusion:

These data suggest that EA has a significant effect on a signaling pathway in brain areas of FM mice. These findings suggest the value of EA for clinical practice.

"OBJECTIVES:

Fibromyalgia is a complex, debilitating, multifactorial condition that can be difficult to manage. Recommended treatments are usually delivered in outpatient settings; evidence suggests that significant inpatient care occurs. We describe the scale and cost of inpatient care with a primary diagnostic code of fibromyalgia within the English National Health Service.
METHODS:

We conducted a cohort-level observational study of all patients admitted to hospital due to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2018 inclusive, in the National Health Service in England. We used data from Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care to study: the age and sex of patients admitted, number and costs of admissions, length of stay, procedures undertaken, class and type of admission, and distribution of admissions across clinical commissioning groups.
RESULTS:

A total of 24 295 inpatient admissions, costing œ20 220 576, occurred during the 4-year study period. Most patients were women (89%) with peak age of admission of between 45 and 55 years. Most admissions were elective (92%). A number of invasive therapeutic procedures took place, including a continuous i.v. infusion (35%). There was marked geographical variation in the prevalence and cost of inpatient fibromyalgia care delivered across the country, even after accounting for clinical commissioning group size.
CONCLUSIONS:

Many patients are admitted for treatment of their fibromyalgia and given invasive procedures for which there is weak evidence, with significant variation in practice and cost across the country. This highlights the need to identify areas of resource use that can be rationalized and diverted to provide more effective, evidence-based treatment.",PubMed
"OBJECTIVES:

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic painful condition partly due to alterations in pain modulation by the central nervous system. Multicomponent therapy (MT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had both been reported as pain modulators in FM patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of rTMS on pain with a combination of MT and rTMS versus MT.
METHODS:

Thirty-nine FM patients with pain visual analogue scale (pVAS) ò 40mm were randomized to active or sham rTMS (high frequency, primary motor cortex M1) plus 12 weeks of MT (3 sessions per week combining aerobic training, pool based exercises and relaxation). rTMS was started 2 weeks prior MT and maintained until the end of the program (week 14). Assessments were achieved at baseline, at week 14, and 6 months (week 40) after completing the program. The main outcome was the pain reduction, assessed by the weekly mean daily self-reported level of pain. Secondary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness (graded maximal exercise test), cardiac autonomic adaptations and fibromyalgia impact (fibromyalgia impact, depression, sleep efficiency and pain catastrophizing scales).
RESULTS:

The reduction of the weekly mean daily pain did not differ significantly between groups (repeated measures of ANOVA). Two-way ANOVAs showed that pVAS, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, depression and catastrophizing, improved significantly at week 14 and remained stable until week 40. Neither Cardiac autonomic adaptations nor sleep efficiency changed significantly.
CONCLUSION:

rTMS did not reduce pain in FM patients who followed the MT program.",PubMed
"The pathogenesis of fibromyalgia is still unknown. Core symptoms include pain, depression and sleep disturbances with high comorbidity, suggesting alterations in the monoaminergic system as a common origin of this disease. The reserpine-induced myalgia model (RIM) lowers pain thresholds and produces depressive-like symptoms. The present work aims to evaluate temporal dynamics in the oscillatory profiles and motor activity during sleep in this model and to evaluate if the model mimics the sleep disorders that occur in fibromyalgia patients. Hippocampal and EMG activity were recorded in chronically implanted rats. Following 3?days of basal recordings, reserpine was administered on 3 consecutive days to achieve the RIM. Post-reserpine recordings were taken on alternate days for 21?days. Reserpine induced changes in the sleep architecture with more transitions between states, and a different pattern between the administration period and post-reserpine weeks. Administration days were characterized by a larger amount of REM sleep with dominant theta waves without atonia. Following the reserpinization, theta oscillations were always more fragmented and with lower frequency. On the post-reserpine days, sleep was dominated by slow-wave sleep with fast intrusions and reduced hierarchical coupling with spindles and ripples. Simultaneous electromyography recordings also showed muscle twitches during sleep and the dissociation of theta activity and muscle atonia. Abnormally high slow waves, alpha/delta intrusions, frequent transitions and muscle twitches are common traits in fibromyalgia. Therefore, our analyses support the validity of the reserpine-induced myalgia model to study sleep disorders in fibromyalgia, and provide new insights into the research of oscillographic biomarkers.

"Many pain conditions in patients tend to co-occur, influencing the clinical expressions of each other in various ways. This paper summarizes the main concurrent pain conditions by analyzing the major interactions observed. In particular, co-occurrence will be examined in: visceral pain (especially ischemic heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome, dysmenorrhea/endometriosis and urinary pain), fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal pain and headache. Two concurrent visceral pains from internal organs sharing at least part of their central sensory projection can give rise to viscero-visceral hyperalgesia, i.e., enhancement of typical pain symptoms from both districts. Visceral pain, headache and musculoskeletal pains (myofascial pain from trigger points, joint pain) can enhance pain and hyperalgesia from fibromyalgia. Myofascial pain from trigger points can perpetuate pain symptoms from visceral pain conditions and trigger migraine attacks when located in the referred pain area from an internal organ or in cervico-facial areas, respectively. The pathophysiology of these pain associations is complex and probably multifactorial; among the possible processes underlying the mutual influence of symptoms recorded in the associations is modulation of central sensitization phenomena by nociceptive inputs from one or the other condition. A strong message in these pain syndrome co-occurrence is that effective treatment of one of the conditions can also improve symptoms from the other, thus suggesting a systematic and thorough evaluation of the pain patient for a global effective management of his/her suffering.

"The available pharmacological modalities for the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM) are associated with a variety of adverse effects and limited benefits. In this study, we systematically reviewed the impact of melatonin in the treatment of FM. Interventional studies, either controlled or uncontrolled and randomized or non-randomized, were included. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched without time limitation. Primary outcome measures were the effect of melatonin on the disease impact, pain, sleep quality, tender point count, fatigue, anxiety, stiffness, and depression in FM patients. Four studies, reporting the effect of melatonin on 98 patients, were eligible to include. All the studies reported the positive effect of melatonin on the FM symptoms. No major adverse event was reported. A significant level of heterogeneity was observed between the studies. Therefore, further high-quality controlled clinical trials are needed to understand the role of melatonin in FM treatment fully.

"Objective:

The study was designed to develop fibromyalgia assessment screening tool (FAST) indices based only on multidimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) scores as clues to fibromyalgia (FM), analyzed for possible agreement with the 2011 FM criteria.
Methods:

All patients with all diagnoses complete an MDHAQ at each visit in routine care. The MDHAQ includes scores for physical function, pain, global assessment, fatigue, self-report painful joint count, and a 60-symptom checklist. MDHAQ items similar or identical to the 2011 FM criteria symptom severity scale (SSS) and widespread pain index (WPI) components of a polysymptomatic distress scale (PSD) were compiled into continuous MDHAQ-FM-SSS, MDHAQ-FM-WPI, and MDHAQ-FM-PSD indices. Ten candidate MDHAQ scores were analyzed against the 2011 FM criteria using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlations, kappa statistics, and receiver operating characteristic curves for the area under the curve (AUC). MDHAQ candidate variables with the highest AUC were compiled into cumulative MDHAQ-FAST indices of three (FAST3) or four (FAST4) scores.
Results:

The highest AUCs among MDHAQ scores were seen for symptom checklist, painful joint count, fatigue, and pain, which are included in FAST4; FAST3-F excludes pain, and FAST3-P excludes fatigue. AUCs for FAST3-P, FAST3-F, and FAST4, as well as continuous MDHAQ-FM scores, all were greater than 0.92, indicating excellent criterion validity. Kappa statistics versus the 2011 criteria were 0.63-0.68, higher than 0.41-0.47 versus physician ICD-10 diagnoses.
Conclusion:

Pragmatic FAST3, FAST4, and MDHAQ-FM indices are similar to FM criteria to screen for FM in routine care. It is more feasible to collect the same MDHAQ, which is informative in all rheumatic diseases studied, from each patient than to ask different patients with different diagnoses to complete different questionnaires.",PubMed
"Background:

Recently, some studies suggested that clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia is inaccurate and does not reflect current definitions. However, this hypothesis has not been tested. We examined whether fibromyalgia was accurately diagnosed in the community.
Methods:

We surveyed 3276 primary care patients to determine current fibromyalgia status by criteria (CritFM). We also determined whether the patients had a physician's diagnosis of fibromyalgia (MDFM) and the level of symptom severity as measured by the polysymptomatic distress scale (PSD).
Results:

The prevalence of MDFM and CritFM was 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3%, 6.9%) and 5.5% (95% CI 4.8%, 6.3%), respectively. However, only 32.2% with MDFM met 2016 criteria (CritFM), and only 35.4% with CritFM also had MDFM. The kappa statistic for diagnostic agreement was 0.296 (minimal agreement). The mean PSD score was 12.4 and 18.4 in MDFM and CritFM, respectively. The odds ratio for being a woman compared with being a man was 3.2 for MDFM versus 1.9 for CritFM, P = 0.023. Of the patients with MDFM, 68.3% received specific fibromyalgia pharmacotherapy.
Conclusions:

There is little agreement between MDFM and CritFM. Only one-third of MDFM satisfy fibromyalgia criteria, and only one-third of patients who meet the criteria have a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Physician diagnosis is biased and more likely in women. Fibromyalgia treatment is common in MDFM (70.7%). Overall, MDFM appears subjective and unrelated to fibromyalgia criteria. There appears to be no common definition of fibromyalgia in the community.",PubMed
"AIM:

Previous studies suggest higher mindfulness may be associated with better sleep quality in people with chronic pain conditions. However, the relationship between mindfulness and sleep in fibromyalgia patients, who commonly suffer from sleep problems, remains unstudied. We examined the relationship between mindfulness and sleep, and how this relationship may be mediated by depression, anxiety, and pain interference in fibromyalgia patients.
METHOD:

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial in fibromyalgia patients. We measured mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), sleep quality and disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], PROMIS Sleep Disturbance [PROMIS-SD]), pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference), and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Pearson correlations were used to examine associations among mindfulness and sleep quality and disturbance. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess whether pain interference, depression, and anxiety mediated the relationship between mindfulness and sleep.
RESULTS:

A total of 177 patents with fibromyalgia were included (93% female; mean age 52 ñ 12 years; body mass index 30 ñ 7 kg/m2 ; 59% White). Higher mindfulness was associated with better sleep quality and less sleep disturbance (PSQI r = -0.23, P = .002; PROMIS-SD r = -.24, P = .002) as well as less pain interference (r = -.31, P < .0001), anxiety (r = -.58, P < .001), and depression (r = -0.54, P < .0001). Pain interference, depression, and anxiety mediated the association between mindfulness and sleep quality and disturbance.
CONCLUSION:

Higher mindfulness is associated with better sleep in patients with fibromyalgia, with pain interference, depression, and anxiety mediating this relationship. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the potential effect of cultivating mindfulness on sleep in fibromyalgia.

"BACKGROUND:

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a disorder with a population prevalence of 1% to 5%. There are insufficient data in the literature on the incidence of FMS in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), with only a limited number of studies conducted.
OBJECTIVES:

The aim of this study was to determine the presence of FMS in patients diagnosed with axial SpA and to investigate the effect of this coexistence on clinical and laboratory assessments in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
STUDY DESIGN:

This research involved a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.
SETTING:

The research took place in an outpatient rheumatology clinic.
METHODS:

This study included 125 patients diagnosed with axial SpA according to the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society criteria. The presence of FMS was investigated according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Pain during activity, resting, and at night was examined using the Visual Analog Scale. Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Scores were used for assessment of disease activity, Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Scale was used for quality of life, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index was used for functionality, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used for sleep quality.
RESULTS:

Incidence of FMS was 29.6% in the study population, which consisted of patients who were all diagnosed with axial SpA. Comparison of patient groups with and without FMS revealed no statistically significant differences in age, weight, body mass index, marital status, family history, and smoking history (P > .05), with a higher rate of female patients in the group with FMS at 55% (P < .05). Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-C-Reaktif Protein, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-Erythyrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Scale, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Visual Analog Scale pain scores were significantly higher in the group with FMS (P < .05).
LIMITATION:

The study involved a limited number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS:

FMS is observed in one-third of patients with axial SpA. The presence of FMS negatively affects quality of life, functional status, sleep quality, disease activity, and pain level of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The possibility for coexistence of FMS should be kept in mind when determining the treatment protocols for patients with axial spondyloarthritis, and adjunctive treatment should be given if necessary.

"The aim of our study was to understand how male partners of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome perceive sexuality. Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenology and the Roy Adaptation Model provided the overall framework for this research study. Eighteen participants were recruited through convenience and purposive sampling. Data collection was conducted between February and July of 2017 and included a focus group and twelve in-depth interviews. Two main themes were extracted: ""facing a new sex life"" and ""resisting the loss of the couple's sexuality"". Fibromyalgia syndrome compromises the couple's sex life. Enhancing intimacy, skin-to-skin contact (during acute FMS outbreaks), finding new positions, non-coital sex and use of sex toys can increase female desire and help coping.",PubMed
"BACKGROUND:

The main somatic symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) are chronic musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, and fatigue, all of which are related to the muscle system and its functioning.
AIMS:

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the asymptomatic upper and lower extremity muscles evaluated using ultrasonography (US) were different from healthy controls in both newly diagnosed and established FMS and to assess whether muscle measurements were related to fatigue and disease severity, as well as quality of life.
METHODS:

This study was conducted on 152 subjects (102 patients and 50 healthy controls) as a cross-sectional controlled trial. Real-time imaging of cross-sectional thickness (CST) (for deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, forearm flexor, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius medialis), and cross-sectional areas (CSAs) (quadriceps femoris (QF)) measurements were performed using US. Fatigue and disease severity as well as quality of life scales were given to all participants.
RESULTS:

In both patient groups, decreased QF muscle CSA was significantly correlated with increased fatigue severity and decreased overall quality of life and energy levels. Moreover, in patients with established disease, there was a significant correlation between the decrease in QF muscle CSA and increased social isolation and between the decrease in biceps brachii muscle CST and increased fatigue severity.
CONCLUSIONS:

Whether in newly diagnosed or established disease, muscle measurement values and quality of life parameters were significantly decreased in patients with FMS compared with healthy controls.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) could cause significant morbidity due to neuropathic pain and autonomic dysfunction. SFN is underdiagnosed and the knowledge on the condition is limited among general public and health care professionals. This review is intended to enhance the understanding of SFN symptoms, causes, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic options.
RECENT FINDINGS:

There is evidence of SFN in up to 40% patients with fibromyalgia. The causes of SFN are glucose metabolism defect, dysimmune, gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, monoclonal gammopathy, vitamin deficiencies, toxic agents, cancer, and unknown etiology. Auto-antibodies targeting neuronal antigens trisulfated heparin disaccharide (TS-HDS) and fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGFR3) are found in up to 20% of patients with SFN. Treatment of SFN includes treating the etiology and managing symptoms. SFN should be considered in patients with wide-spread body pain. The search for known causes of SFN is a crucial step in disease management.

"The fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a chronic widespread pain condition whose etiology remains unknown and no treatment has satisfactory levels of success. A meta-analysis has identified a distinct Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) clinical profile between FM female patients and healthy controls, and differences between FM and other chronic pain condition with clear etiology have also been found. However, heterogeneity in this population has been suggested in several studies. We aim to assess clinical aspects in FM patients, based on personality psychopathology characteristics, in order to explore heterogeneity and the existence of core common aspects. In this cross-sectional study, a relatively homogeneous sample of 56 female FM patients (Mage = 45.95, SDage = 9.39) was assessed through MMPI-2. A K-Means cluster analysis identified two clusters, one (n = 24) with clinically significant levels in Negative Emotionality and Introversion scales. Subsequent MANOVAs identified important features of this cluster on several MMPI-2 dimensions. Moreover, several dimensions are clinically elevated in both clusters. In conclusion, the combination of psychopathological negative emotionality, interpersonal isolation, and low hedonic capacity, in a group of patients, has implications for the daily living and treatment of FM patients, and several core aspects of FM need to be addressed.",PubMed
