"OBJECTIVES:

This study aims to evaluate the clinical importance of intermetatarsal distance, size of neuroma, and proportion of neuroma in the intermetatarsal space in examinations of Morton neuroma using ultrasonography.
METHODS:

Clinical prognosis was observed prospectively after corticosteroid injections in 136 patients with Morton neuroma, and the results were compared with ultrasonographic parameters of intermetatarsal distance, size of neuroma, and proportion of neuroma in the intermetatarsal space.
RESULTS:

Twenty-one patients (15%) did not respond to corticosteroid injections and underwent surgical treatment for Morton neuroma. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the size of the neuroma was the sole predictor of failure of corticosteroid injections (P?=?.002). No other factors were significant for the prediction of clinical prognosis (P?>?.05).
CONCLUSIONS:

The size of the neuroma on ultrasonography is the sole predictor of corticosteroid injection failure, while intermetatarsal distance and proportion of neuroma in the intermetatarsal space are not significant when predicting clinical prognosis of Morton neuroma.

"OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this work is to compare the effectiveness of blind and ultrasound-guided injection for Morton's neuroma (MN) to determine which is more appropriate as the initial procedure in conservative treatment.
METHODS:

This is an evaluator-blinded randomised trial. Of the 56 included patients, 27 were assigned to the blind group (A) and 29 to the ultrasound-guided group (B). Injection includes 1 ml of 2% mepivacaine and 40 mg of triamcinolone in each web space with MN. The included patients were assessed clinically by VAS score and the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Score (MFPDS). The follow-up was performed at 15 days, 1 month, 45 days, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after the initial injection.
RESULTS:

No differences in age or clinical measurements were found at presentation between group A and group B. At the follow-up, the ultrasound-guided group showed greater symptomatic relief at several stages of the follow-up: 45 days (VAS 3.0 ñ 0.5 versus 5.5 ñ 0.5, p = 0.001; MFPDS: 32.2 ñ 1.8 versus 38.8 ñ 2.0, p = 0.018), 2 months (VAS: 3.1 ñ 0.5 versus 5.6 ñ 0.5, p = 0.002; MFPDS: 31.5 ñ 1.9 versus 38.5 ñ 2.1, p = 0.020) and 3 months (VAS: 3.1 ñ 0.4 versus 5.2 ñ 0.6, p = 0.010; MFPDS: 31.2 ñ 1.9 versus 37.7 ñ 2.4, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSION:

Injection of MN under ultrasound guidance provides a statistically significant improvement at some stages of the follow-up (45 days, 2 and 3 months), compared with blind injection.
KEY POINTS:

? Ultrasound-guided steroid injections in Morton's neuroma provide short-term pain relief to over 60% of the patients. ? Ultrasound-guided injections in Morton's neuroma lead to a higher percentage of short-term pain relief than blind injections. ? Ultrasound-guided injections in Morton's neuroma lead to a lower percentage of skin side effects than blind injections.

"PURPOSE:

To determine whether ultrasound allows precise assessment of the course and relations of the medial plantar proper digital nerve (MPPDN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This work was initially undertaken in six cadaveric specimens and followed by a high-resolution ultrasound study in 17 healthy adult volunteers (34 nerves) by two musculoskeletal radiologists in consensus. Location and course of the MPPDN and its relationship to adjacent anatomical structures were analysed.
RESULTS:

The MPPDN was consistently identified by ultrasound along its entire course. Mean cross-sectional area of the nerve was 0.8 mm2 (range 0.4-1.4). The MPPDN after it branches from the medial plantar nerve was located a mean of 22 mm (range 19-27) lateral to the medial border of the medial cuneiform. More distally, at the level of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, mean direct distances between the nerve and the first metatarsal head and the medial hallux sesamoid were respectively 3 mm (range 1-8) and 4 mm (range 2-9).
CONCLUSION:

The MPPDN can be depicted by ultrasonography. Useful bony landmarks for its detection could be defined. Precise mapping of its anatomical course may have important clinical applications.
KEY POINTS:

? The medial plantar proper digital nerve (MPPDN) rises from the medial plantar nerve to the medial side of the hallux. ? Because of its particularly long course and superficial position, the MPPDN may be subject to trauma, resulting in a condition known as Joplin's neuroma. ? The MPPDN can be clearly depicted by ultrasound along its entire course. Precise mapping of its anatomical course may have important clinical applications.

"Schwannoma is a common neoplasm in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Sciatic nerve schwanommas are rare. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman who was referred for treatment of persistent neuropathic pain in the left lower limb after resection of a schwannoma on the left S1 nerve root. The patient's history goes back when she was 27 years old and started to have electric-like pain in her lower left limb upon intercourse. Examination revealed a left ovarian cyst which was surgically removed. Her pain persisted despite taking nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several years later a schwannoma on the left S1 nerve root was detected. The patient had surgical excision of the left S1 nerve root at the plexus along with the schwannoma. Following the surgery, she experienced pain upon sitting and touch, and had a limp in her left leg. She was prescribed NSAIDs, antidepressant and pregabalin. Despite the pharmacological treatment, the patient had persistent mild pain. Upon physical examination, the incision from her previous surgery was 4 cm away from the sacral midline and parallel to S1 and S2. The length of the incision was 3 cm. The patient had severe allodynia upon palpation at the area between S1 and L5 and the visual analog scale (VAS) score increased from 3 to 10. She had severe pain at rest and movement. Her neurologic exam revealed that the left lower extremity motor power showed mild weakness in the leg abduction, foot eversion, plantar and toes flexion, and in the hip extension. The sensory exam showed severe reduction in pinprick and temperature sensation in the lateral aspect of foot, lower leg and dorsolateral thigh and buttocks. Nerve stimulator guided injection was performed at the pain trigger point being 1 cm above the midline of the incision. Upon nerve stimulation the contraction of the gluteal muscle was observed. Then, 20 mL of the anesthetic mixture were injected. The patient had immediate pain relief after the block (VAS 1/10). She remained pain free for 15 days after which pain reappeared but with less severity (3/10). Repetitive sciatic nerve block was performed in a progressive manner and was shown to be effective in managing neuropathic pain.

"Although many treatment modalities are available for Morton's neuroma, the injection of the neuroma with alcohol has gained popularity. However, recently, some investigators have observed a progressive deterioration in pain scores for patients initially pain free after the treatment. The purpose of the present retrospective comparative study was to determine whether mechanical metatarsalgia is related to symptom recurrence. We included 104 consecutive cases of ultrasound-guided alcohol injection for Morton's neuroma in 92 patients. Of these 104 cases, 51 were in group A (49%; Morton's neuroma) and 53 in group B (51%; Morton's neuroma associated with mechanical metatarsalgia). We evaluated each patient using a visual analog scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society forefoot scale, and Johnson satisfaction scale, with a mean follow-up period of 24 (range 12 to 39) months. Concomitant functional and mechanical disorders have been identified and treated with orthopedic inserts. The present study compared the clinical results and recurrence of symptoms in patients with isolated Morton's disease or Morton's disease associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. Of the 104 cases, the patients for 93 cases (89%) were completely satisfied or satisfied with minor reservations. No major complications developed. Symptoms recurred in 6 patients (6%), in whom neuroma was associated with mechanical disorders (p = .0269). Ultrasound-guided alcohol injection of Morton's neuroma is a relatively safe and well-tolerated treatment. Symptom recurrence is often associated with mechanical metatarsalgia. The treatment of the concomitant anatomical and functional disorders that target the genesis of the neuroma has an important role in the prevention of recurrence of this pathology.

"An intermetatarsal neuroma is a plantar digital neuritis causing metatarsalgia of the affected inter-metatarsal space. At present the evidence to support the management of the condition is poor with only some quality evidence supporting the short-term management of intermetatarsal neuromas using steroid injections. Some authors have supported the use of alcohol sclerosing intra-lesional injections to treat intermetatarsal neuromas. Following a search of the evidence 11 articles were identified. The systematic review found that alcohol injections appear to be safe although some papers report a short-term side effect of a flogistic reaction and there are variances in the alcohol concentration used and guiding verses not guiding the injection using ultrasound imaging. Some of the evidence may suggest a sclerosing histological effect of the nerve. However, all the studies reviewed present a research design offering a low level of evidence that is open to methodological biases and interpretation. Thus, this review found insufficient high-quality research evidence to afford conclusions on the management of intermetatarsal neuromas with alcohol sclerosing agent injections.

"The anterior approach to the ankle for surgery can result in injury to the superficial peroneal nerve, resulting in a painful neuroma and significant patient morbidity. A paucity of data is available evaluating the role of the superficial peroneal nerve to deep peroneal nerve transfer as a method of treatment of neuromas in continuity after ankle arthrodesis. We describe 11 patients who underwent nerve transfer with nerve allograft and conduit repair to treat recalcitrant painful neuromas after ankle arthrodesis. At a mean follow-up period of 31 months, the mean visual analog pain scale score had improved from 7.9 preoperatively to 2.45 postoperatively (p?<?.0001). These data suggest that nerve transfer with a nerve allograft can provide significant clinical improvement for painful neuromas of the peripheral nerves at the ankle.

"Abstract
BACKGROUND:

The purpose of this research was to see if there were any differences in peak pressure, contact time, pressure-time integrals, and geometric variables such as forefoot width, foot length, coefficient of spreading, and arch index between subjects with Morton's neuroma (MN) and control subjects.
METHODS:

Dynamic peak plantar pressure, contact time, pressure-time integral, and geometric data were extracted using the EMED-X platform in 52 subjects with MN and 31 control subjects. Differences in peak pressure, contact time, pressure-time integral, and geometric data between participants with and those without MN were determined using independent-samples t tests. There were no significant differences in age, weight, height, and body mass index between patients with MN and control subjects.
RESULTS:

There were no significant differences in the peak pressures of all masked areas and pressure-time integrals under metatarsal 2 to 4 heads between patients with MN and control subjects. In addition, no significant differences were observed between patients with MN and control subjects in geometric measurements of forefoot length, width, coefficient of spreading, foot progression angle, and arch index.
CONCLUSION:

No relationship was found in this study between peak pressure, contact time, and pressure-time integral under the metatarsal heads, forefoot width, foot length, coefficient of spreading, and foot progression angle in a symptomatic MN group compared with a control group. The need to perform osteotomies to treat MN not associated with other lesser metatarsal phalangeal joint pathologies is questionable.

"We report the case of a 61-year old patient with no particular previous history who complained of pain with paraesthesias at the level of the anterolateral compartment of the left leg irradiating to the dorsal side of the ankle and the foot which lasted over six months. These pains were made worse by effort. Clinical examination showed partial sensitivity deficit and positive Tinel's sign in the territory of the superficial peroneal nerve (A). Electromyography (EMG) confirmed peroneal nerve involvement with decreased amplitude of sensory potentials. X-ray ruled out the presence of an underlying osteo articular cause (B). Ultrasound objectified well-defined homogeneous tissue formation (C) while MRI showed fusiform mass centered on the nerve with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted hyposignal and T2-weighted hypersignal (D). Conservative surgical resection with sparing of nerve fascicles (E,F) and anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of benign schwannoma (G). At 1-month follow-up, symptoms had disappeared with sensitivity conservation in the territory of this nerve. The diagnosis of schwannoma is difficult due to the absence of swelling and because schwannoma may mimic entrapment neuropathy, as in the case of our patient. Schwannomas are resectable peripheral nerve tumors. Their prognosis is excellent after adapted surgical treatment with sparing of nerve fascicles.

"BACKGROUND:

The treatment of Morton's neuroma (MN) can be operative, conservative and infiltrative. Our aim was the evaluation of evidence on outcomes with different types of conservative, infiltrative and surgical treatment in patients affected by primary MN.
METHODS:

The bibliographic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, DARE. Only studies in English were collected. The last search was in August 2015. Case series and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing patients' satisfaction or pain improvement at an average follow-up of at least 6 months after treatment of primary MN were included. Two reviewers selected the studies, evaluated their methodological quality, and retrieved data independently.
RESULTS:

Of 283 titles found, only 29 met the inclusion criteria. Data showed better outcomes with operative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS:

The evaluated case series and few RCTs showed better results with invasive treatment. More and better RCTs which evaluate risk-benefit ratio are required to confirm these results.

"Morton's neuroma is one of the most common causes of metatarsalgia. Despite this, it remains little studied, as the diagnosis is clinical with no reliable instrumental diagnostics, and each study may deal with incorrect diagnosis or inappropriate treatment, which are difficult to verify. The present literature review crosses all key points, from diagnosis to surgical and nonoperative treatment, and recurrences. Nonoperative treatment is successful in a limited percentage of cases, but it can be adequate in those who want to delay or avoid surgery. Dorsal or plantar approaches were described for surgical treatment, both with strengths and weaknesses that will be scanned. Failures are related to wrong diagnosis, wrong interspace, failure to divide the transverse metatarsal ligament, too distal resection of common plantar digital nerve, an association of tarsal tunnel syndrome and incomplete removal. A deep knowledge of the causes and presentation of failures is needed to surgically face recurrences.

"Background:

There is limited evidence for defining what specific method or methods should be used to clinically influence clinical decision making for forefoot neuroma. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical assessment protocol that has agreed expert consensus for the clinical diagnosis of forefoot neuroma.
Methods:

A four-round Delphi consensus study was completed with 16 expert health professionals from either a clinical or clinical academic background, following completion of a structured literature review. Clinical experience ranged from 5 to 34 years (mean: 19.5 years). Consensus was sought on the optimal methods to achieve the clinical diagnosis of forefoot neuroma. Round 1 sought individual input with an open ended question. This developed a list of recommendations. Round 2 and 3 asked the participants to accept or reject each of the recommendations in the list in relation to the question: ""What is the best way to clinically diagnose neuroma in the forefoot?"" Votes that were equal to or greater than 60% were accepted into the next round; participant's votes equal to or less then 20% were excluded. The remaining participant's votes between 20 to 60% were accepted and placed into the following round for voting. Round 4 asked the participants to rank the list of recommendations according to the strength of recommendation they would give in relation to the question: ""What is the best way to clinically diagnose neuroma in the forefoot?"" The recruitment and Delphi rounds were conducted through email.
Results:

In round 1, the 16 participants identified 68 recommendations for the clinical diagnosis of forefoot neuroma. In round 2, 27 recommendations were accepted, 11 recommendations were rejected and 30 recommendations were assigned to be re-voted on. In round 3, 36 recommendations were accepted, 22 recommendations were rejected and 11 recommendations were assigned to be re-voted on. In round 4, 21 recommendations were selected by the participants to form the expert derived clinical assessment protocol for the clinical diagnosis of forefoot neuroma. From these 21 recommendations, a set of themes were established: location of pain, non weight bearing sensation, weight bearing sensation, observations, tests and imaging.
Conclusion:

Following the identification of 21 method recommendations, a core set of clinical diagnostic methods have been prepared as a clinical assessment protocol for the diagnosis of forefoot neuroma. Based on expert opinion, the core set will assist clinicians in forming a clearer diagnosis of forefoot neuroma.

"BACKGROUND:

The purpose of this paper is to assess pain, function and complications after decompression of Mortons neuroma using a minimally invasive dorsal approach.
METHOD AND RESULTS:

16 patients who underwent 19 decompressions were followed-up for 18 months. Pain was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS), and function was assessed with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale. Data was analyzed with the Student t test for related samples, which yielded a p value 0.05. The possible postoperative complications assessed were: skin problems, infections, wound dehiscence, delayed bone healing and recurrence.
CONCLUSION:

Minimally invasive decompression of Mortons neuroma is a procedure that provides pain relief and improvement in function, with a low complication rate.

"BACKGROUND:

In the dorsal incisional approach for Morton's neuroma, it is required to transect the deep transverse metatarsal ligament (DTML) that lies in the interspace between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between transection of the DTML in the third intermetatarsal space and the metatarsal alignment.
METHODS:

Nine human cadaveric lower extremity limbs were used for this study. Each limb was mounted to the MTS 858 Mini Bionix biomechanical test system and loaded to 120% of the donor's documented body weight at a rate of 15 lbf/s, in order to simulate peak weightbearing ground reactive forces on the forefoot. Preoperative and immediate postoperative radiographs were obtained. Cyclic loading was then performed to simulate 1 month of full weightbearing. Radiographs were repeated and metatarsal alignment was analyzed.
RESULTS:

A statistically significant difference was noted with intermetatarsal angle (IMA) 1-2 and IMA 1-4. The IMA 1-2 after 1 month cycling time showed statistical significant difference from those found immediately postoperatively (P < .05). Average increase in IMA 1-2 from preoperative to 1 month cycling time was 2.18ø. The power of the analyses for IMA 1-2 was 0.992. Regarding the IMA 1-4, data recorded at 1 week and 1 month cycling times showed a statistically significant difference compared to the preoperative IMA 1-4 (P < .05). Average increase in IM 1-4 angles from preoperative to 1 month cycling time was an increase of 1.79ø. The power of the analyses for IM 1-4 angles was 0.953.
CONCLUSION:

Technically, 2.18ø increase in IMA 1-2 or 1.79ø increase in IM 1-4 would be considered an abnormal widening of the forefoot, but clinically, these values could not be detected; nor should they deter a surgeon or patient from undergoing a Morton's neurectomy via a dorsal incisional approach.

"BACKGROUND:

Morton's neuroma is one of the common causes of forefoot pain. In the present study, hyaluronic acid injection was performed on patients to determine the efficacy and adverse effects of hyaluronic acid in management of Morton's neuroma.
METHODS:

Eighty-three patients with Morton's neuroma in their third intermetatarsal space with definite Mulder's click were included in the study. Those with severe forefoot deformities such as forefoot cavus or hallux valgus on plain X-rays were excluded. Ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injections were performed on all patients weekly for 3 weeks. Pain during walking using visual analogue scale (VAS) and AOFAS Forefoot Scale were prospectively evaluated preinjection, and at 2, 4, 6, 12 months postinjection.
RESULTS:

Significant improvement in VAS and AOFAS Forefoot Scale were seen overall at 2 months after hyaluronic acid injections ( P < .05). Then, there were almost no changes after 4 months, continuing until 12 months. The mean VAS was decreased from 73.1 initially to 23.0 at 12 months and AOFAS Forefoot Scale was increased from 32.2 to 86.5. There were no complications which occurred.
CONCLUSION:

In the present study, ultrasound-guided hyaluronic injection was clinically effective for pain relief and functional improvement for at least 12 months in patients with Morton's neuroma. However, numbness associated with Morton's neuroma should be addressed more cautiously since it may persist without much improvement.

"PURPOSE:

Morton's neuroma (MN) is a leading cause of disability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) in patients with chronic pain refractory to conservative therapies.
METHODS:

Between September 2012 and December 2016, RF was performed on 52 patients. A sterile RF needle probe (22G, 5-cm needle with 10-mm electrode active tip) was inserted between the toes into the intermetatarsal space at the center of the lesion. Potential complications of the intervention and post-procedure care were examined. All patients provided written, informed consent. All percutaneous procedures were performed with the NeuroTherm? NT1100 (Neurotherm Inc., M.) device and using ultrasound guidance (Philips IU22). Continuous RF was performed with one cycle of 90 s and with the probe tip maintaining a temperature of 85 øC (impedance 95-210 mê).
RESULTS:

Mean VAS score before the procedures was 9.0 ñ 0.6. A reduction of pain intensity was achieved after 1 week by RF (mean VAS scores 3.7 ñ 0.9; p < 0.05), with a stabilization of the painful symptomatology in the following months and after 1 year of treatments (mean VAS scores 2.0 ñ 0.4 after 12 months, p < 0.05). The FHSQ scores showed improved quality of life (QOL) in all patients at 6 months (p < 0.05) and 1 year (p < 0.05) of RF. No patients developed complications.
CONCLUSIONS:

RF is a safe, efficient, and minimally invasive technique for the treatment of symptomatic MN.

"An unusual case of solitary benign schwannoma of the foot is presented. Clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and intraoperative findings all confirm the suspicion of a ganglion cyst. After attempted aspiration failed to produce any aspirate, excisional biopsy was performed. The pathology report confirms schwannoma with hematoxylin and eosin stain and subsequently reaffirmed with positive S100 protein stain.

"BACKGROUND:

The effectiveness of corticosteroid injection for the treatment of Morton's neuroma is unclear. In addition, most of the studies related to it are case-control or retrospective case series. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness between corticosteroid injection associated with local anesthetic and local anesthetic alone (placebo control group) for the treatment of Morton's neuroma.
METHODS:

Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of Morton's neuroma were randomized to receive 3 injections of either a corticosteroid plus a local anesthetic or a local anesthetic alone. The patients and the researcher who collected data were blinded to the treatment groups. The visual analog scale for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Score (metatarsophalangeal/interphalangeal score) were obtained at baseline, after each injection, and at 3 and 6 months after the last injection.
RESULTS:

There were no significant between-group differences in terms of pain and function improvement at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion in comparison with baseline values. At the end of the study, 17 (48.5%) patients requested surgical excision of the neuroma: 7 (44%) in the experimental group and 10 (53%) in the control group ( P = 1.0).
CONCLUSION:

The injection of a corticosteroid plus a local anesthetic was not superior to a local anesthetic alone in terms of pain and function improvement in patients with Morton's neuroma.
